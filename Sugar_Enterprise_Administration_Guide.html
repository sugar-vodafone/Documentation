        <h2 id="Overview"><a name="Overview_..1178" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Overview</h2>
        <p>Vodafone CRM offers administrators a wide range of configuration options to set up their account. Upon your initial log into Vodafone CRM, you will go through configuring some basic settings (i.e. Your Information, Your Locale, etc.) for your user profile. You may skip these steps and configure these settings in your user preferences at a later time. Once your user profile set up is complete, you will be able to navigate to a specific area of Vodafone CRM to perform various administrative functions (e.g. importing data etc.) as well.Please note that system administrators can also set up each user's basic settings. This documentation will cover the various options available when first accessing your Vodafone CRM account.</p>
        <h2 id="Login_Screen"><a name="Login_Screen" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Login Screen</h2>
        <p>The Vodafone CRM login screen is where you enter your login credentials (user name and password) to access your instance. Enter in your instance URL 
		(e.g. <span>https://example.Vodafone CRMondemand.com</span>) on your web browser to load Vodafone CRM's login screen. If you do not know your instance URL or login credentials, please reach out to another system administrator in your organization for assistance. The Admin Wizard will launch upon your first successful log in to Vodafone CRM allowing you to configure various system-wide settings as well as some personal settings. </p>
        <h3 id="Language"><a name="Language_..1179" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Language</h3>
        <p>User's have the option to choose the primary language they want displayed in Vodafone CRM by clicking the Language icon on the bottom right of the Login screen. The Language dropdown list will appear allowing you to select the appropriate language you want displayed in your Vodafone CRM account. The out-of-the-box default language in Vodafone CRM is English (US), but administrators can change the default language globally via Admin &gt; Locale. For more information on configuring the default language in Vodafone CRM, please refer to the <a href="#Locale" class="selected">Locale</a> section. Once the default language is changed, it will display as the default selection on the login screen for all user's. Please note that you will need to select the language you want displayed each time you log in or the default language will display in Vodafone CRM. Administrators can also configure what languages are available to select in the Language dropdown list via Admin &gt; Languages. For more information on managing the available languages, please refer to the <a href="#Languages" class="selected">Languages</a> section.</p>

        <p>The Your Locale step is where you can configure the date, time, and name format you want displayed in Vodafone CRM based on your current geographical location. Unlike the <a href="Sugar_Enterprise_Application_Guide.html#Locale_Settings">system locale settings</a>, this is where you can specify how you would like data displayed in your specific user account. Please note that the information you provide on this page will override the system locale settings and can be updated in your user preferences at a later time if desired.

        <p>The following page confirms that you are ready to use Vodafone CRM and allows you to perform various administrative functions. Selecting the action item(s) will take you directly to the specific area of the Admin page to import data from external sources, etc. Please note that you can click "Start Vodafone CRM" to go directly into your Vodafone CRM account if you wish to configure these settings at a later time.</p> <p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/ea61d2a3-9a08-2d74-b4a3-55030248caef.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/ea61d2a3-9a08-2d74-b4a3-55030248caef.png" width="513" height="279" /></p><h1 id="Team_Management"><a name="Team_Management" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a><a name="Team"></a>Team Management</h1><h2 id="Overview"><a name="Overview_..1180" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Overview</h2><p>Team Management is used in Vodafone CRM to define permissions and groupings for users. These permissions cover what records a user is and is not able to access. Teams are used in conjunction with <a href="#Role_Management" class="selected">Roles</a> to form a robust security model for non-admin users in Vodafone CRM. Users can use team settings on specific records to allow different users within Vodafone CRM the option to view these given records. Team settings can also be used as a form of organization, thereby separating records to be associated to specific teams for better tracking. Teams can be based on departments, geographic regions, or whatever else works best in a given organization.</p><h2 id="Teams_Module_Tab"><a name="Teams_Module_Tab" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Teams Module Tab</h2><p>The Teams module tab is accessed by navigating to the Admin menu and clicking on Team Management under the Users panel. Clicking on the Team Management link will bring you to the Teams list view and show the Teams module tab. You may hover on the tab to display the Actions and Recently Viewed menus for Teams. The Actions menu allows you to perform important actions within the module. The <a href="#Viewing_Via_Recently_Viewed" class="selected">Recently Viewed</a> menu displays the list of teams you last viewed in the module.</p><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d9974a51-b893-13c8-a2b3-550300108a48.png" alt="" width="333" height="208" /></p><p>The Actions menu allows you to perform the following operations:</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Menu Item</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td><a href="#Creating_Teams" class="selected">Create Team</a></td><td>Opens the edit view to create a new team</td></tr><tr><td><a href="#Viewing_Teams" class="selected">Teams</a></td><td>Opens the list view layout to search and display teams</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Team_Types"><a name="Team_Types" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Team Types</h2><p>From an administrative standpoint, teams will be handled differently based on their types. From a user standpoint, all teams will be treated pretty much the same. Each team type has their own special set of characteristics that aid in defining it. The team types defined as:</p><ul><li value="1"><a href="#The_Global_Team" class="selected">The Global Team</a></li><li value="2"><a href="#Standard_Teams" class="selected">Standard Teams</a></li><li value="3"><a href="#Private_Teams" class="selected">Private Teams</a></li></ul><h3 id="The_Global_Team"><a name="The_Global_Team" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>The Global Team</h3><p>The Global team is created automatically when a Vodafone CRM instance is created. Global is the default team for all new users, and every user is a member of the team by default. Global is a universal team, so any records associated to the global team will be viewable by the users on this team. The global team is intended to be available for all users and a shared team for all users in Vodafone CRM.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> You cannot delete the Global team.</p><h3 id="Standard_Teams"><a name="Standard_Teams" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Standard Teams</h3><p>Standard Teams can be created by administrators via Team Management. These are to be used throughout Vodafone CRM to organize and grant access on organizational specifics to your organization. Standard teams are often broken out into groups by departments, geographical regions, or duties. For example, you may have an East and West team, and also a Sales and Support team.</p><h3 id="Private_Teams"><a name="Private_Teams" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Private Teams</h3><p>For every user that is created in Vodafone CRM, a corresponding private team is automatically created in the Teams module. By default, the private team name is the user's first and last name. A private team name will be updated any time the corresponding user's profile is edited and re-saved, even if the change was not made to the user's first or last name. For example, the private team for Jane Smith will be automatically named "Jane Smith". If the administrator edits private team "Jane Smith" to "Jane Smith-HR", and then user Jane Smith later updates the phone number on her user profile, Vodafone CRM will revert the private team name back to the user's first and last name, "Jane Smith".</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Private teams are not deleted in the same method as other teams. For more information on deleting private teams, please review the <a href="#Deleting_Teams" class="selected">Deleting Teams</a> section of this guide.</p><h2 id="Team_Membership_Types"><a name="Team_Membership_Types" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Team Membership Types</h2><p>Team memberships are given to users in one of two ways, either by explicit or implicit membership. Regardless of the type, membership will control what records <a href="#Regular_User" class="selected">regular users</a> are able to see. Each membership can be granted in different ways and can constitute different functionality. Team membership is represented in the team's <a href="#Teams_Detail_View" class="selected">detail view</a>, as well as the user's <a href="#Users_Detail_View" class="selected">detail view</a>.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Administrators do not adhere to team security and therefore can see all records.</p><p>Explicit team membership is forged when the relationship is defined from either the team's or user's detail view. In addition, explicit relationships are also represented with <a href="#Private_Teams" class="selected">private team</a> memberships. Explicit memberships, other than private teams, can be <a href="#Removing_Users_From_Teams" class="selected">removed</a> as necessary from the team's or user's detail view. Explicit memberships will also include membership functionality for actions such as <a href="#Workflow_Management" class="selected">workflows</a> or <a href="#Inbound_Email" class="selected">inbound email</a>.</p><p>Implicit team membership is used for record visibility. Implicit membership relies on the "Reports To" field in the <a href="Sugar_Enterprise_Application_Guide.html#User_Profile">User Profile</a>. When one user reports to another, the hierarchy of the "Reports To" field is kept in tact. The user being reported to will inherit the team membership of the subordinate user and be able to see any records on both his or her own team, and the teams of which the subordinate user is a member. The subordinate's teams can either be explicit or implicit teams in this scenario.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Implicit relationships cannot be removed, but the cause for their relationship can be broken by changing the reporting hierarchy.</p><p>In the Team's detail view, the user's subpanel will showcase which relationships are explicit and which are implicit. In the "Membership" column of the Users subpanel, the user will either be marked as a "Member", meaning that they are an explicit member, or "Member Reports-to", meaning they are an implicit member. In addition, the users marked with the "Member Reports-to" will not include an "Unlink" button, as they have another user (or users) reporting to them on this team.</p><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/19c467ad-997f-12e8-39c0-5503009757cf.png" alt="" width="570" height="183" /></p><h2 id="Creating_Teams"><a name="Creating_Teams" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Creating Teams</h2><p>There are two methods that can be used to create teams in Vodafone CRM. These are via the Teams module tab's action list or by duplicating an existing team and then editing it. After initially creating the team, the administrator will need to associate users to the <a href="#Adding_Users_to_Teams_Via_Teams_Module" class="selected">newly created team</a>.</p><p>For information on creating Private Teams, please review the <a href="#Repairing_Teams" class="selected">Repairing Teams</a> section of this documentation.</p><h3 id="Creating_Via_Teams_Module"><a name="Creating_Via_Teams_Module" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Creating Via Teams Module</h3><p>The most common way to create a new team is via the Create Team option in the Team Management <a href="#Teams_Module_Tab" class="selected">module tab</a>. This opens up the edit view layout which allows you to enter in all the relevant information for the team.</p><p>Use the following steps to create a team via Team Management:</p><ol><li value="1">Navigate to Admin &gt; Team Management.</li><li value="2">The Teams list view will open displaying all existing teams that are currently available.

The default is set to 500. Some mail servers have one or more of the following restrictions for a specific timeframe (e.g. hour, day, etc.): the number of unique recipients, how many times the same email can be sent to individual recipients, and the most common, how many emails can be delivered. This setting helps control the outgoing email to conform to these restrictions. For example, if your scheduler is set to run every hour, the number of emails to send per batch is set to 500, and you have 1600 emails to send out, starting at 2:00 AM the last batch of emails will be sent at 5:00 AM. Please check with your email provider to determine the proper level.</li><li value="2"><strong>Location of campaign tracking files</strong> : Campaign tracking files log responses from campaign targets. If you are running Vodafone CRM on an external network, select "Default" to accept the default location. However, if your Vodafone CRM instance is behind a firewall, then choose "User Defined" and specify the path to your external web server in the field below. The external web server must have the ability to connect to your Vodafone CRM instance behind the firewall. Ensure that you create a file named index.php to handle requests for three different types of entry points: campaign_trackerv2, removeme, and image, and place the index.php file in the path to your external web server. This index.php file must make the appropriate calls to the index.php file located in the root of your Vodafone CRM instance in order to properly record the activities in Vodafone CRM. </li><li value="3"><strong>Keep copies of campaign messages</strong> : Set this option to "Yes" to keep a copy of every email sent during a campaign. If "No" is selected, the template is stored, but not the individual emails sent. Default is set to "No". </li><p><strong>Note</strong> : Storing every email sent does take up space in the database and can reduce performance. We recommend setting this value to "No".</p></ul><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/9e2163a9-b03d-8b2e-d5a8-550300ba22dd.png" alt="" width="513" height="241" /></p><p>Make any necessary changes and click "Save" to commit the changes.</p><h2 id="Inbound_Email"><a name="Inbound_Email" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Inbound Email</h2><p>Inbound Email allows external email to be pulled into Vodafone CRM and can be accessed from the admin page under the Email section.

The subject and description of the case is populated with the subject and body of the email respectively.

Least busy is defined by the person with the least number of unread emails assigned to them.</li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong> : Case assignment is distributed to all members of the specified team, but excludes any inherited members of the team due to the "Reports To" structure. For more information on teams and the Reports To structure, please refer to the <a href="#Team_Management" class="selected">Team Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p><p>Cases created from email are automatically related to contact and account records that match the email address in the From field of the email.</p><p>If a case auto-reply template is specified the sender of the email will receive an email based on the template selected. The response contains the system generated case number in the subject line of the email based off of the case macro. The body of the email for which the case was created displays below the template text. The case auto-reply ignores the "No Auto-Reply to this Domain" field if populated. </p><p><strong>Note</strong> : If both Auto-Reply and Case Auto-Reply templates are selected, Vodafone CRM will respond to the sender with the Case Auto-Reply template only.</p><h2 id="Email_Queue"><a name="Email_Queue" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Email Queue</h2><p>The Email Queue option in Admin is where Vodafone CRM administrators can monitor and perform actions on queued email. When sending a campaign the emails are not sent immediately, but are queued to be sent. Each queued email has a "Send On" date and time set by the campaign they are sent from. The scheduler "Run Nightly Mass Email Campaigns" takes the queued emails that are ready to be sent based on this date and time and sends them in batches. If an email fails to send from the queue for any reason it will be flagged as a send attempt and, by default, Vodafone CRM will not attempt to send that email for another 24 hours. Once Vodafone CRM reaches six failed attempts to send an email it will be deleted from the queue. In order to send a failed email sooner than the default 24 hours, you can perform a <a href="#Mass_Updating_Queued_Email" class="selected">mass update</a> to reset the In Process field. This section will cover how to use the email queue as well as the various actions and options available from within the email queue.</p><h3 id="Viewing_Via_List_View"><a name="Viewing_Via_List_View_..1231" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Viewing Via List View</h3><p>The email queue list view displays all queued email records meeting the current search criteria.

Please note that Vodafone CRM automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %services). This will pull up any record that has the word "services" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p><p>For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="Sugar_Enterprise_Application_Guide.html#29">Search</a> documentation.</p><h4 id="Basic_Search"><a name="Basic_Search_..1232" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Basic Search</h4><p>Basic search offers a few, commonly used fields for a simplified search experience.

It presents all of the tasks that must be completed in a simplified and streamlined format. Process Author empowers Vodafone CRM administrators to automate vital business processes for their organization. Some examples of business processes that can be automated using Process Author include invoice approvals, lead routing, customer service case routing, and automated reminders and escalations.</p><h3 id="Process_Author_Modules"><a name="Process_Author_Modules" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Process Author Modules</h3><p>In order to seamlessly automate business processes, Process Author suite leverages four interconnected process-related modules. The <a href="#Process_Business_Rules" class="selected">Process Business Rules</a> module and the <a href="#Process_Email_Templates" class="selected">Process Email Templates</a> module are used to create rules and email templates that will be referenced by records created in the <a href="#Process_Definitions" class="selected">Process Definitions</a> module. Once a process definition has been created, it will generate a record in the <a href="Sugar_Enterprise_Application_Guide.html#505_Processes">Processes</a> module each time the process definition is triggered.</p><p>The Process Business Rules, Process Email Templates, and Process Definitions modules can be viewed and configured by any system administrator user. In addition, regular users with a role that provides developer access to one or more modules will be able to access all Process Author functions for those modules. Regular users without developer role permissions will only have access to the Processes module. </p><p>The following image illustrates the relationship between the Process Author modules:</p><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/eeee68ca-d305-6eb3-6222-550302806231.png" alt="" width="445" height="334" /></p><p>The following table describes the four Process Author modules and their intended use. To learn more about any of the modules, click on the hyperlinked module name.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>We recommend reading this page in its entirety before moving on to other Process Author sections.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1"><tbody><tr><th><strong>Module</strong></th><th><strong>Description</strong></th></tr><tr><td><a href="#Process_Definitions" class="selected">Process Definitions</a></td><td><p>A process definition defines the steps in an overall business process. Process definitions are created by a Vodafone CRM administrator. The process definition consists of a network of activities and their relationships, criteria to indicate the start and end of the process, and information about the individual activities (e.g., participants) contained within the business process.</p></td></tr><tr><td><a href="Sugar_Enterprise_Application_Guide.html#505_Processes">Processes</a></td><td><p>A process is a running instance of a process definition. A single process begins every time a process definition is executed. For example, a single process definition could be created to automate quote approvals, but because users may engage in several quote approvals per day, each approval will be represented by a separate process instance, all governed by the single process definition. In other words, the Processes module is the many-to-one (M:1) child module of Process Definitions.</p><p>The Processes module is the only Process Author module that is visible to regular users. From the Processes dashlet and module list view, they will be able to see running processes if there is anything for them to approve, reject, or review.</p><p>There are three ways an administrator can view a list of processes:</p><ul><li value="1"><b>Processes module list view :</b> List views for the Processes module display processes that require the logged-in user to take approve, reject, or review action. Admin users, like regular users, will only see the processes that are waiting for them. List views can be accessed by navigating to Processes &gt; View Processes.</li><li value="2"><strong><a href="#Processes_Dashlet" class="selected">Processes dashlet</a> : </strong><span>This dashlet d</span>isplays processes that require the logged-in user to take approve, reject, or review action. Admin users, like regular users, will only see the processes that they need to act upon.</li><li value="3"><span><b><a href="#Process_Management_List_View" class="selected">Process Management page</a> : </b>This is the one place in Vodafone CRM where an administrator can see all running, cancelled, and completed processes. From the Process Management page, the admin can also </span>monitor process status, reassign or cancel an in-progress process, or repair processes in an error state. The Process Management page is accessible via the Admin &gt; Process Author panel or via the Processes module tab by clicking on "Process Management".</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><a href="#Process_Business_Rules" class="selected">Process Business Rules</a></td><td><p>A process business rule is a reusable set of conditions and outcomes that can be embedded in a process definition. The set of rules may enforce business policy, make a decision, or infer new data from existing data. For example, if Sally manages all business opportunities of $10,000 or more, and Chris manages all business opportunities under $10,000, a process business rule can be created and used by all relevant process definitions to ensure that the assignment policy is respected. In the case of an eventual personnel change, only the process business rule will need to be edited to affect all related processes.</p></td></tr><tr><td><a href="#Process_Email_Templates" class="selected">Process Email Templates</a></td><td><p>A process email template is required in order to include a Send Message event in a process definition. Vodafone CRM's core product includes several places where email templates can be created for different purposes, but Process Author requires all sent messages to be created via the Process Email Templates module.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Basic_Visual_Notation_Elements"><a name="Basic_Visual_Notation_Elements" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Basic Visual Notation Elements</h3><p>Process Author depends on process definitions created by the administrator using a Visual Designer tool.

The Start event will always be characterized Vodafone CRM module selected as the record's Target Module, but will vary by conditions such as whether it applies to newly created records or updated records. </p><p><strong>Note: </strong>A process definition's target module will be the same module that is used for the Start event.</p><p>A Start event is represented by a green circle on the Visual Designer canvas.</p></td></tr><tr><td><a href="#Adding_Intermediate_Events" class="selected">Intermediate Events</a></td><td><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5b4cd28c-5e68-cb95-ba43-55030249695b.png" alt="" width="132" height="46" /></p></td><td><p>As the name suggests, Intermediate events occur after a process starts but before the process is complete. Intermediate events that are placed within the overall process flow represent things that happen during the normal operation of the process such as sending messages, receiving messages, or mandatory waiting periods.</p><p>Intermediate events are represented by blue circles in the Visual Designer.</p></td></tr><tr><td><a href="#Adding_Form_Activities" class="selected">Activities</a></td><td><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/3a9193c7-1314-e218-05ca-550302a50a51.png" alt="" width="105" height="55" /></td><td><p>The only unit of work that may require a user response (opposed to automation) is an Activity.

When several activities may result in a common outcome, a gateway serves as a merging mechanism, or a "converging" element. When a single activity may result in several different outcomes, a gateway serves as a splitting mechanism, or a "diverging" element.</p><p>A Gateway is represented by a diamond in the Visual Designer.</p></td></tr><tr><td><a href="#Adding_End_Events" class="selected">End Events</a></td><td><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/9b40689b-cef3-9b6e-00ce-55030297857b.png" alt="" width="146" height="46" /></td><td>End events signal completion of a process.

To import records into the Process Definitions, Process Email Templates, or Process Business Rules modules, the import file must be formatted as the appropriate proprietary file type, as shown in the table below.

For example, an administrator may choose to design process definitions in a sandbox or development instance before moving them to a production environment. For this, the files would be exported from the dev instance as .bpm files and then imported into the production instance's Process Definitions module. </p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Process Definitions may contain references to Business Rules and Email Templates.

If Chris or Sally eventually leaves the company and a new salesperson is hired, only the process business rule will need to be edited to affect all related process definitions and their running processes.</p><h2 id="Creating_a_Process_Business_Rule_Record"><a name="Creating_a_Process_Business_Rule_Record" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Creating a Process Business Rule Record</h2><p>You should typically create business rules before creating any process definitions that will use the rules.

In the following example of a set of rules for routing leads, each row of the Rules Builder table represents a separate rule that will be evaluated by the process. Each row is evaluated independently in descending order. When a rule in the rule set is evaluated as true, the evaluation process stops. Therefore, only the conclusions defined by the first (topmost) true condition will be returned.</p><p>The following example represents a rule set that evaluates the fields "Lead Score" and "Lead Source" to determine a return value and assigned user. The first row translates conversationally to: If the lead's score is greater than or equal to 50, and the lead's source is a Cold Call, then capture the office phone number and assign the lead to Chris Olliver.</p><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a9623201-2e21-3584-629f-55030215dc5f.png" alt="" width="537" height="186" /></p><h3 id="The_Rules_Builder_User_Interface"><a name="The_Rules_Builder_User_Interface" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>The Rules Builder User Interface</h3><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/863785ce-87e0-5c62-e43e-550302f2ddeb.png" alt="" width="622" height="159" /></p><ul><li value="1">Click the plus (+) icon to the right of the Conditions header to add additional condition columns.</li><li value="2">Click the plus (+) icon to the right of the Conclusions header to add additional conclusion columns.</li><li value="3">Click the plus (+) icon to the far left of the column headers to add additional rows and create a rule set.</li><li value="4">Click the minus (-) icon next to a single row to remove that entire row.</li><li value="5">Click the small black square (◼) in the corner of a column header to remove that entire column.</li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: All conditions defined within the same row must be met in order to trigger the associated conclusion.

It defines the action that will trigger a new process to run. The Start event will always be characterized by a module record in Vodafone CRM, but will vary by whether it applies to newly created records or updated records. It is possible for a single process definition to have multiple Start events, for example, one Start event triggered by updated records and a second Start event triggered by created records. All Start events in a process definition should eventually merge into a single flow.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>The target module chosen in the process definition's record view is the module that is used for the Start event in the process definition design.</p><p>Start events are represented by the Vodafone CRM icon, the first icon on the design toolbar.</p><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/337869dd-d74b-4cce-7fd8-55771e3151b5.png" alt="start-toolbar" width="607" height="190" /></p><p>Follow these steps to add a Start event to the process definition:</p><ol><li value="1">Drag the Start event icon onto the Designer canvas.</li><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/9a0344b1-0450-eb28-fcd8-557720f120cc.png" alt="drag-new-start" width="266" height="206" /></p><li value="2">Double-click the Start event icon's label to re-name it.</li><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/1e5c3729-fda7-9719-250f-557724e494c5.png" alt="rename-start" width="270" height="78" /></p><p>Note: The Start event will have an error alert (!) icon warning you to add an outgoing sequence flow element.

When the Sales Stage dropdown field is updated, the corresponding probability is automatically populated in the Probability (%) field. This is a unique function to the Revenue Line Items module. These two fields use the two dropdown lists, "sales_stage_dom" and "sales_probability_dom". Both dropdown lists have the same item name for all values but different display labels. The sales_stage_dom list is associated to the Sales Stage field and displays the various sales stages (e.g. prospecting, qualification, closed won, etc.). The sales_probability_dom list is associated to the Probability (%) field and displays the corresponding probability value (e.g. 10, 20, 100, etc.) for each sales stage.</p><p>When any changes are made to the sales_stage_dom list, you must consider the sales_probability_dom list as well to ensure the relationship between the two fields remain intact. For example, if you add a new sales stage (e.g. Item Name: "review_stage", Display Label: "Review Stage") to the sales_stage_dom list then you must add a corresponding probability (e.g. Item Name: "review_stage", Display Label: "50") to the sales_probability_dom list in order for it to populate properly in the revenue line item. The two lists' item names and order must match.</p><p>The Opportunities module's Status field uses the sales_status_dom list . Modifying this list is not recommended as the values in this dropdown are tied to the Revenue Line Item module's Sales Stage field. Making changes to this dropdown list's item names via code or Studio can cause unexpected behavior. For more information regarding the Status field, please refer to the <a href="Sugar_Enterprise_Application_Guide.html#Opportunities">Opportunities</a> documentation. </p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The dropdown lists "sales_stage_dom" and "sales_probability_dom" must have "Closed Won" and "Closed Lost" as item names in order for the Forecasts module to function correctly. Please ensure any changes to these lists does not remove or change the item name for these two options.</p><p>For sales_stage_dom list:</p><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e4561ce1-abdb-6b9c-6b8b-550300031ee4.png" alt="Sales_stage_dom_list" width="400" height="230" /></p><p>For sales_probability_dom list:</p><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b054571e-6f7b-23bc-6c5f-550300caab83.png" alt="Sales_probability_dom_list" height="223" width="326" /></p><p>For sales_status_dom list:</p><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5c3e9964-6aab-fb6d-f332-55030005d85e.png" alt="dev_tools_sales_status_dom" width="306" height="237" /></p><h4 id="Editing_Time_Intervals"><a name="Editing_Time_Intervals" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Editing Time Intervals</h4><p>The "After Time Elapsed" workflow triggers after a specified period of time has elapsed from when a record save occurs in Vodafone CRM. For more information on "After Time Elapsed" workflows, please refer to the <a href="#">Workflow Management</a> documentation. When creating the conditions for the workflow, you have the option to specify the time interval (e.g. 0 hours, 4 hours, 1 day, 1 week, etc.) used by the system to execute the workflow. The available time interval values can easily be modified via the Dropdown Editor.</p><p>The Dropdown Editor contains the "tselect_time_dom" list, which allows administrators to configure the time intervals used for time elapsed workflows. To add new time intervals to the dropdown list, simply enter the "Item Name" and "Display Label", keeping in mind that the item name must display the number of seconds corresponding to the new time interval. The display label value should have the time as it relates to minutes, hours, days, etc. For example, if you are adding 2 hours to the time interval list, the item name value will be "7200" and the display label will show "2 hours".</p><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b887526a-0a27-f7a6-c5b9-55028883e664.png" alt="Workflow_TimeIntervalDropdown_Edit" height="193" width="288" /></p><h1 id="Rename_Modules"><a name="Rename_Modules" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Rename Modules</h1><p>Depending on your business needs, it may be necessary to alter the display label to make the module's name (e.g. Contacts, Accounts, etc.) align to your various business components. Administrators can easily rename modules via Admin &gt; Rename Modules. When editing a name, you are given the option to update both the singular and plural version of the word. This change will be reflected globally across Vodafone CRM so that every use of the given module name is updated to your preference, seamlessly to all users.
