Upon your initial log into Sugar, you will go through configuring some basic settings (i.e. Your Information, Your Locale, etc.) for your user profile. You may skip these steps and configure these settings in your user preferences at a later time. Once your user profile set up is complete, you will be able to navigate to a specific area of Sugar to perform various administrative functions (e.g. importing data, creating users, configuring the application via Studio, etc.) as well.Please note that system administrators can also set up each user's basic settings when creating a user in Sugar. This documentation will cover the various options available when first accessing your Sugar account.</p></div><div><h2 id="c78db5-4ebc-d3c1-073d-570e8ae9e78c_Login_Screen">Login Screen</h2><p>The Sugar login screen is where you enter your login credentials (user name and password) to access your instance. Enter in your instance URL (e.g. <span>https://example.sugarondemand.com</span>) on your web browser to load Sugar's login screen. If you do not know your instance URL or login credentials, please reach out to another system administrator in your organization for assistance. The Admin Wizard will launch upon your first successful log in to Sugar allowing you to configure various system-wide settings as well as some personal settings. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/36475abf-5863-290c-e080-550302d57a13.png" alt="Login_Dialog" height="186" width="257" /></p><div><h3 id="c78db5-4ebc-d3c1-073d-570e8ae9e78c_Language">Language</h3><p>User's have the option to choose the primary language they want displayed in Sugar by clicking the Language icon on the bottom right of the Login screen.

These permissions cover what records a user is and is not able to access. Teams are used in conjunction with <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Role_Management">Roles</a> to form a robust security model for non-admin users in Sugar. Users can use team settings on specific records to allow different users within Sugar the option to view these given records. Team settings can also be used as a form of organization, thereby separating records to be associated to specific teams for better tracking. Teams can be based on departments, geographic regions, or whatever else works best in a given organization.</p></div><div><h2 id="c8dd34-fa93-bd05-90fb-570e8a2ba2ee_Teams_Module_Tab">Teams Module Tab</h2><p>The Teams module tab is accessed by navigating to the Admin menu and clicking on Team Management under the Users panel. Clicking on the Team Management link will bring you to the Teams list view and show the Teams module tab. You may hover on the tab to display the Actions and Recently Viewed menus for Teams. The Actions menu allows you to perform important actions within the module. The <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Team_Management/#Viewing_Via_Recently_Viewed">Recently Viewed</a> menu displays the list of teams you last viewed in the module.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d9974a51-b893-13c8-a2b3-550300108a48.png" alt="teams_MT" width="333" height="208" /></p><div><div>The Actions menu allows you to perform the following operations:</div></div><br /><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Menu Item</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Team_Management/#Creating_Teams">Create Team</a></td><td>Opens the edit view to create a new team</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Team_Management/#Viewing_Teams">Teams</a></td><td>Opens the list view layout to search and display teams</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><h2 id="c8dd34-fa93-bd05-90fb-570e8a2ba2ee_Team_Types">Team Types</h2><p>From an administrative standpoint, teams will be handled differently based on their types. From a user standpoint, all teams will be treated pretty much the same. Each team type has their own special set of characteristics that aid in defining it. The team types defined as:</p><ul><li><a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Team_Management/#The_Global_Team">The Global Team</a></li><li><a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Team_Management/#Standard_Teams">Standard Teams</a></li><li><a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Team_Management/#Private_Teams">Private Teams</a></li></ul><h3 id="c8dd34-fa93-bd05-90fb-570e8a2ba2ee_The_Global_Team">The Global Team</h3><p>The Global team is created automatically when a Sugar instance is created. Global is the default team for all new users, and every user is a member of the team by default. Global is a universal team, so any records associated to the global team will be viewable by the users on this team. The global team is intended to be available for all users and a shared team for all users in Sugar.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> You cannot delete the Global team.</p><h3 id="c8dd34-fa93-bd05-90fb-570e8a2ba2ee_Standard_Teams">Standard Teams</h3><p>Standard Teams can be created by administrators via Team Management. These are to be used throughout Sugar to organize and grant access on organizational specifics to your organization. Standard teams are often broken out into groups by departments, geographical regions, or duties. For example, you may have an East and West team, and also a Sales and Support team.</p><h3 id="c8dd34-fa93-bd05-90fb-570e8a2ba2ee_Private_Teams">Private Teams</h3><p>For every user that is created in Sugar, a corresponding private team is automatically created in the Teams module. By default, the private team name is the user's first and last name. A private team name will be updated any time the corresponding user's profile is edited and re-saved, even if the change was not made to the user's first or last name. For example, the private team for Jane Smith will be automatically named "Jane Smith". If the administrator edits private team "Jane Smith" to "Jane Smith-HR", and then user Jane Smith later updates the phone number on her user profile, Sugar will revert the private team name back to the user's first and last name, "Jane Smith".</p><p>If your organization plans to edit private team names, you must disable the automatic update feature. Navigate to Admin &gt; System Settings and select the checkbox next to "Prevent private team names from inheriting the user's name fields". For more information on this setting, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/System">System</a> documentation.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Private teams are not deleted in the same method as other teams. For more information on deleting private teams, please review the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Team_Management/#Deleting_Teams">Deleting Teams</a> section of this guide.</p><h2 id="c8dd34-fa93-bd05-90fb-570e8a2ba2ee_Team_Membership_Types">Team Membership Types</h2><p>Team memberships are given to users in one of two ways, either by explicit or implicit membership. Regardless of the type, membership will control what records <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Users">regular users</a> are able to see. Each membership can be granted in different ways and can constitute different functionality. Team membership is represented in the team's <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Team_Management/#Teams_Detail_View">detail view</a>, as well as the user's <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Users">detail view</a>.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Administrators do not adhere to team security and therefore can see all records.</p><p>Explicit team membership is forged when the relationship is defined from either the team's or user's detail view. In addition, explicit relationships are also represented with <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Team_Management/#Private_Teams">private team</a> memberships. Explicit memberships, other than private teams, can be <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Team_Management/#Removing_Users_From_Teams">removed</a> as necessary from the team's or user's detail view. Explicit memberships will also include membership functionality for actions such as <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Developer_Tools/Workflow_Management">workflows</a> or <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Email">inbound email</a>.</p><p>Implicit team membership is used for record visibility. Implicit membership relies on the "Reports To" field in the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Getting_Started">User Profile</a>. When one user reports to another, the hierarchy of the "Reports To" field is kept in tact. The user being reported to will inherit the team membership of the subordinate user and be able to see any records on both his or her own team, and the teams of which the subordinate user is a member. The subordinate's teams can either be explicit or implicit teams in this scenario.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Implicit relationships cannot be removed, but the cause for their relationship can be broken by changing the reporting hierarchy.</p><p>In the Team's detail view, the user's subpanel will showcase which relationships are explicit and which are implicit. In the "Membership" column of the Users subpanel, the user will either be marked as a "Member", meaning that they are an explicit member, or "Member Reports-to", meaning they are an implicit member. In addition, the users marked with the "Member Reports-to" will not include an "Unlink" button, as they have another user (or users) reporting to them on this team.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/19c467ad-997f-12e8-39c0-5503009757cf.png" alt="Membership_users_panel_reports_to" width="570" height="183" /></p><h2 id="c8dd34-fa93-bd05-90fb-570e8a2ba2ee_Creating_Teams">Creating Teams</h2><p>There are two methods that can be used to create teams in Sugar. These are via the Teams module tab's action list or by duplicating an existing team and then editing it. After initially creating the team, the administrator will need to associate users to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Team_Management/#Adding_Users_to_Teams_Via_Teams_Module">newly created team</a>.</p><p>For information on creating Private Teams, please review the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Team_Management/#Repairing_Teams">Repairing Teams</a> section of this documentation.</p><h3 id="c8dd34-fa93-bd05-90fb-570e8a2ba2ee_Creating_Via_Teams_Module">Creating Via Teams Module</h3><p>The most common way to create a new team is via the Create Team option in the Team Management <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Team_Management/#Teams_Module_Tab">module tab</a>. This opens up the edit view layout which allows you to enter in all the relevant information for the team.</p><p>Use the following steps to create a team via Team Management:</p><ol><li>Navigate to Admin &gt; Team Management.</li><li>The Teams list view will open displaying all existing teams that are currently available.

Roles work in conjunction with <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Team_Management">Teams</a> to form a robust security model for non-admin users in Sugar. Roles control three different layers of access for users within Sugar: module, field, and action-level access.</p><p>Administrators have the ability to create different roles and assign regular users to the roles. A user can be associated to any number of roles, and when multiple roles are applied, Sugar adheres to a most-restrictive policy to determine the user's appropriate access levels. Administrators cannot be associated to roles as their administrative rights supersede any restrictions imposed by Role Management. For more information on System Administrator users, please review the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Users">User Management</a> documentation.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Roles are only able to allow or deny access to the entire Forecasts module. Because the data used in the Forecasts module makes use of data in the Opportunities, Products, Quotas, Worksheet and TimePeriod modules, the Forecasts module does not respect the module or field-level ACLs specified in these modules. For example, the opportunities data that is shown in the Forecasts module worksheets will be shown and editable regardless of whether or not the user has access to the Opportunities module or has field-level restrictions in that module.</p><p>In addition, the Reports module does not respect certain field-level role restrictions meaning that generated reports may display field data for which a user's role is set to restrict visibility.</p><h2 id="ca20a3-0ef4-cb67-e400-570e8a9f1724_Roles_Module_Tab">Roles Module Tab</h2><p>The Roles module tab can be accessed by navigating to the Admin page and clicking "Role Management" in the Users section.

Sugar allows administrators to set up system-generated passwords versus manually created passwords for new users, failed login lockout attempts, and configure the email templates used to send password information to users. Password management is not used to change user's passwords, which can be done via their <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Getting_Started">User Profile</a>.</p><h2 id="cb6ca3-ebf2-8e0f-3429-570e8a53f148_Password_Requirements">Password Requirements</h2><p>The Password Requirements panel lets you configure minimum and maximum lengths of passwords, as well as what characters are required in passwords. Filling in either of the first two fields, Minimum Length and Maximum Length, will force a requirement for your users to have passwords be more than or less than a given amount of characters. Additionally, use any of the four checkboxes to force character requirements on users' passwords. This can force users to include upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, or special characters in their passwords.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/1a7c337b-f066-55ff-4d4d-550300d51f7d.png" alt="Password_Requirements" width="577" height="178" /></p><h3 id="cb6ca3-ebf2-8e0f-3429-570e8a53f148_Advanced_Options">Advanced Options</h3><p>You can also specify words or other strings that are not allowed in a password, called Regex Requirements. The configurations for Regex Requirements are found in the Advanced Options section of the Password Requirements panel.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/1327e512-1473-f9ca-574f-5503009e3009.png" alt="Advanced_Options" width="675" height="122" /></p><p>To set a Regex Requirement, type in code of characters that are not allowed. In the Regex Description field, write a message to users that will show when they try to edit their passwords, explaining what strings are not allowed. For more information on Regex usage, please review the Regular Expressions website at <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/">http://www.regular-expressions.info/</a>.</p><p>Some examples of regular expressions in password rules are listed below:</p><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Sample Expression</strong></td><td><strong>Password Rule</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Sugar</td><td>Password cannot contain the word Sugar.</td></tr><tr><td>([A-Za-z0-9])\1</td><td>Password cannot repeat a letter or number consecutively; for example, AA or 88.</td></tr><tr><td>([a-zA-Z]){4,}</td><td>Password cannot repeat any two consecutive letters; repeat characters or letters must be separated by a special character such as %.</td></tr><tr><td>[ \t]</td><td>Password cannot contain spaces and tabs.</td></tr><tr><td>[@#$]</td><td>Password cannot contain @, #, or $.</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><h2 id="cb6ca3-ebf2-8e0f-3429-570e8a53f148_System-Generated_Passwords">System-Generated Passwords</h2><p>When enabled, the System-Generated Passwords feature will allow users to receive a randomly generated password via email. This functionality is utilized either when a new user is created or when an administrator activates the Reset Password button in the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Users">user's profile</a>.</p><p>The two requirements to utilize system-generated passwords are:</p><ul><li>A user has a valid primary email address configured in their <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Getting_Started">User Profile</a>.</li><li>A system outbound email server (SMTP) is configured in <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Email">Email Settings</a>.</li></ul><p>For security reasons, when the System-Generated Passwords feature is enabled, you also have the option to set an expiration for the system-generated password. You can specify when the temporary password expires, either after a certain amount of days, months, or weeks, or after a specified number of logins. Simply click the radio button next to the expiration you would like to use and enter in the login or length of time variable as necessary, or click "None" for the password to never expire. Once the temporary password expires, users will see a message upon login, informing them that the password has expired and to create a new password. The user will need to enter in the temporary password along with the new password and confirm the password as well. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d61fedae-3d04-7e47-31c8-5503001873d2.png" alt="PasswordManagement_SystemGeneratedPasswords" width="780" height="179" /></p><h2 id="cb6ca3-ebf2-8e0f-3429-570e8a53f148_User_Reset_Password">User Reset Password</h2><p>The forgot password feature allows administrators to enable the Forgot Password link to display in the Sugar login window. If a user does not remember their password, they can click this option, enter in their user name and their primary email address in Sugar, and a Reset Password link will be emailed, guiding them through the process to reset their forgotten password. For more information on how a user resets his or her password, please view the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Getting_Started">Getting Started</a> documentation.</p><p>The two requirements to utilize Forgot Password feature are:</p><ul><li>A user has a valid primary email address configured in their <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Getting_Started">User Profile</a>.</li><li>A system outbound email server (SMTP) is configured in <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Email">Email Settings</a>.</li></ul><h3 id="cb6ca3-ebf2-8e0f-3429-570e8a53f148_CAPTCHA_Validation">CAPTCHA Validation</h3><p>As an additional precaution, you can enable CAPTCHA validation to prevent automated programs from gaining unauthorized access to user accounts. When enabled, when a user attempts to use the Forgot Password feature, they will have to confirm a CAPTCHA, in addition to providing their user name and primary email address.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/2f9a11ce-8d2e-c1f3-d2f9-5503002d77d4.png" alt="captcha_on_login" width="459" height="234" /></p><p>Use the following steps to enable CAPTCHA for the Forgot Password menu:</p><ol><li>Create an account with reCAPTCHA from the reCAPTCHA website at <a href="http://recaptcha.net/">http://recaptcha.net/</a></li><li>After creating an account, save your Public Key and Private Key which will be entered into Sugar</li><li>In Sugar, navigate to Password Management and the "User Reset Password" panel</li><li>Click the checkbox to Enable reCAPTCHA Validations</li><li>Enter the Public Key and Private Key in the fields provided <p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/49570f86-5c8d-7dda-f138-550300f045ec.png" alt="Captcha" width="858" height="91" /></p></li></ol><h3 id="cb6ca3-ebf2-8e0f-3429-570e8a53f148_Honeypot_Validations">Honeypot Validations</h3><p>Honeypots are a non intrusive method of human form submission confirmation that is more effective than traditional CAPTCHA. Enabling the honeypot validation option will add an invisible input field to the Forgot Password form which only bots reading the HTML will be able to see. When the bots fill in the honeypot field, Sugar knows to disregard the submission since it was not created by a human, thus preventing unauthorized access to your Sugar instance.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/47c29cff-4aec-8684-bd2d-5503003285af.png" alt="PasswordManagement_HoneypotValidations" width="487" height="69" /></p><h2 id="cb6ca3-ebf2-8e0f-3429-570e8a53f148_Email_Templates">Email Templates</h2><p>Sugar comes standard with two password templates. One is for the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Password_Management/#System-Generated_Passwords">System-Generated Password</a> emails that are sent out, and the other is for the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Password_Management/#User_Reset_Password">Reset Password</a> email.

This means that you will define a specific amount of unsuccessful attempts that a user name can be used to log in before the user name will not be able to log in. You also configure a given amount of time before the restriction is listed in either minutes, hours, or days. To configure Login Lockout, click the radio button next to "Lockout users after {blank} unsuccessful login attempts", fill in the maximum number of attempts allowed and define the timeframe.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/eff6fb42-1403-ebec-ccc0-56f40f6ed36e.png" alt="login-lockout-77" width="500" height="116" /></p><p><strong>Note</strong>: When a user has been locked out, the user must wait until the given timeframe has passed.

When users in your system attempt to log into Sugar, the application will authenticate them against SAML. If authentication is successful, the user is granted access to Sugar. If the authentication is unsuccessful, Sugar will then attempt to verify the provided credentials against its own database of valid user names and passwords. Sugar supports the use of SAML versions 1.1 and 2.0.</p><p>To configure SAML, navigate to Admin &gt; Password Management, and click the "Enable SAML Authentication" checkbox near the bottom of the screen. All other screen options will be removed and you will be presented with a page of only options for LDAP.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5df00fdb-e2b3-7af8-a9aa-56f41f31b52d.png" alt="saml-settings" width="600" height="340" /></p><p>Fill in the appropriate options in the following fields, and then click "Save" to commit the changes.</p><ul><li><strong>Enable SAML Authentication</strong> : Uncheck this box if you would like to disable SAML Authentication in your instance.</li><li><strong>Login URL</strong> : Enter the SAML URL for authentication.

Setting a regular user's password is done simply through the Users module via Admin &gt; User Management. This method will vary depending on the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Password_Management/#System-Generated_Passwords">System-Generated Passwords</a> option. For more information on changing a user's password from the Users module, please review the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Users">Resetting User Passwords</a> section of the Users documentation.</p></div><div><p><small><b>Last Modified:</b> 10/07/2016 03:44pm</small></p></div><h1 id="id-39cca5e2-f66a-cba4-593e-570e8a3fd6c1">User Management</h1><div><h2 id="cca5e2-f66a-cba4-593e-570e8a3fd6c1_Overview">Overview</h2><p>The User Management module provides administrators access to create, edit, activate, and deactivate the profiles of all the users in their Sugar instance. This module and underlying settings control each individual's login credentials as well as some personalized settings. During the installation process, Sugar creates one system administrator by default. The system administrator can log in and create additional users, in a variety of capacities, to be able to access Sugar and utilize all of the other CRM functionality. In combination with the role and team security, administrators can fully establish a profile for each user in Sugar.</p><h2 id="cca5e2-f66a-cba4-593e-570e8a3fd6c1_User_Types">User Types</h2><div><p>There are four different types of users in Sugar: Regular User, System Administrator, Group User, and Portal API User. Each user type has different functions and uses in Sugar which will vary for each instance. Depending on an organization's use of Sugar, not all of these user types will necessarily be used.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Users with an inactive status do not count towards the number of Sugar licenses purchased for the organization. Group Users and Portal API Users never count against the number of Sugar licenses regardless of status.</p></div><h3 id="cca5e2-f66a-cba4-593e-570e8a3fd6c1_Regular_User">Regular User</h3><p>A regular user is the most common of the user types. A majority of employees of an organization will be regular users. This user can access most Sugar modules and perform most every day-to-day function. Regular users are subject to be restricted in their abilities and what records they can access by an administrator using the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Team_Management">Teams</a> and <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Role_Management">Roles</a> functionalities in Sugar.</p><p>Regular Users will appear in the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Employees">Employees</a> module. To create a Regular User, please review the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Users/#Regular_and_Admin_Users">Regular and Admin Users</a> section of this documentation.</p><h3 id="cca5e2-f66a-cba4-593e-570e8a3fd6c1_System_Administrator">System Administrator</h3><p>System Administrator users, or "admins," have all of the abilities and functionality of a regular user, but also have administrative privileges as well. Admins can perform functions such as creating and editing users, editing system wide settings, and have access to diagnostic and troubleshooting tools. In addition, admins can access all modules and records, and are not subject to team or role restrictions. All instances of Sugar require at least one administrator, but it is also recommended to have more than one in case the original admin is unavailable or is no longer with the company.</p><p>System Administrators will appear in the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Employees">Employees</a> module.To create a System Administrator, please review the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Users/#Regular_and_Admin_Users">Regular and Admin Users</a> section of this documentation.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: All administrators where the user status is active count as a licensed user.</p><h3 id="cca5e2-f66a-cba4-593e-570e8a3fd6c1_Group_User">Group User</h3><p>A Group User is a bucket that is used for assigning records to a non-specific user (e.g. Sales, Support) in the organization. Unlike a Regular or System Administrator user, a Group user does not have access to log in to Sugar. Due to this, they do not have the same profile settings available, including the option to set a password. Since Group users cannot log in to Sugar, they do not count against an organization's license count.</p><p>Examples of uses for a Group user would be to assign all new leads to a group user named "Sales" or assign all new support cases to "Support" before they are delegated to specific users (e.g., John Smith) in the organization.</p><p>Please note that Group users will not appear in the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Employees">Employees</a> module. For more information on how to create a Group user, please review the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Users/#Group_Users">Group Users</a> section of this documentation.</p><div><h3 id="cca5e2-f66a-cba4-593e-570e8a3fd6c1_Portal_API_User">Portal API User</h3><p>A Portal API User is similar to a Group User except that it is created specifically to communicate with the Sugar server using the Sugar Portal SOAP API functionality. It is intended only for use with Sugar Portal and is enabled when the Sugar Portal is enabled via Admin &gt; Sugar Portal. It must remain enabled in order for portal users to authenticate. Using legacy Sugar Portal (an external application) also requires the enablement of this user. This user can only be used to authenticate contact credentials against SOAP V1 portal API methods in Enterprise and Ultimate editions. To create a Portal API user, please review the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Users/#Portal_API_Users">Portal API Users</a> section of this documentation.</p><p>Portal API Users will not appear in the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Employees">Employees</a> module and are not counted in the user license agreement. More information about the Sugar Portal can be found in the Sugar Portal documentation. Sugar's API documentation can be found in the Web Services section of the Developer guide.</p><p><b>Note</b>: The Portal API user is not intended to be a free API user for external integrations and has very limited functionality through the SOAP API.</p></div><h2 id="cca5e2-f66a-cba4-593e-570e8a3fd6c1_User_Fields">User Fields</h2><p>The Users module contains a number of stock fields, which are included out-of-the-box with Sugar. The below definitions are suggested meanings for the fields, but many of the fields can be leveraged differently to best meet your organization's needs. System Administrators have the ability to alter, remove, or add fields in the User Profile tab via Admin &gt; Studio, minus a few noted exceptions.

Sugar automatically re-validates your license once every 90 days as long as a system administrator logs into Sugar within the 90 day period. However, if your system fails to communicate with the License Validation server through the internet or you are behind a firewall; you will have to re-validate the license via Admin &gt; License Management. If the re-validation is successful, the Status field in the License Validation panel will display the timestamp of the successful validation.

Please note that you will be notified of your upcoming subscription renewal via email or call and a notification will appear in the Sugar cube on the upper left of your Sugar account regarding your license expiration. If the subscription is renewed past the expiration date, then administrators must re-validate their license via Admin &gt; License Management in order to update the account with the new subscription. If the administrator does not re-validate the license, regular users will be prohibited from logging into Sugar until the license is successfully validated by the administrator.</p><h4 id="cdebfb-2f69-7417-5074-570e8aaec819_Re-validating_the_License">Re-validating the License</h4><p>Although Sugar automatically re-validates your license once every 90 days, there may be special circumstances where administrators must re-validate the license via License Management. For example, if you renew your subscription after the expiration date or if you purchase additional users mid-term, you will have to re-validate the license via Admin &gt; License Management in order to update your Sugar account with the new subscription.</p><p>The fields in the License Validation panel are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Validation Key</strong> : System generated validation key associated to your Sugar subscription.</li><li><strong>Validation Key Expiration</strong> : The date the validation key expires. The expiration date is typically 90 days from the last successful validation date.</li><li><strong>Status </strong>: The status displaying the timestamp of the last failed or successful validation.</li></ul><p>Use the following steps to re-validate the license in Sugar:</p><ol><li>Navigate to Admin &gt; License Management.</li><li>Click the Re-validate button. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8e8a646b-4a3d-86bd-3405-55028b952173.png" alt="License_Validation" width="490" height="134" /></li></ol><p>The system will communicate with the License Validation server to validate your license based on your Sugar subscription. If the re-validation is successful, then the status will reflect the date and time of the successful validation.

Defaults to sugarcrm.</li><li><strong>Maximum log size</strong> : Specify the maximum size of the log file in megabytes (MB). The default is 10MB. Once a log file reaches the specified size it is renamed to have an incrementing number and a new file will be created to contain new logs.</li><li><strong>Log Level</strong> : Select the event level that you want to capture in the log file. The levels are listed below in order of the most log records to the least. The default level is fatal. When specifying a logging level, the system will create log files for the specified level as well as higher levels. For example, if you select "error", the system creates log files for "error", "fatal", and "security". Please note that there is an inherent overhead to logging. If the log level is set too high, it may cause performance issues. The "info" and "debug" settings are not recommended for continuous use in a production environment. <ul><li><strong>debug</strong> : Logs events that help debug the application</li><li><strong>info </strong>: Logs informational messages</li><li><strong>warn </strong>: Logs potentially harmful events</li><li><strong>error </strong>: Logs error events in the application</li><li><strong>fatal </strong>: Logs severe error events that cause the application to abort</li><li><strong>security</strong> : Logs events that may compromise the security of the application</li><li><strong>off</strong> : The logger will not log any events</li></ul></li><li><strong>Extension</strong> : Specify the file extension for the log file.

OAuth works with a public consumer key and a private consumer key. Together, these keys identify which application connects to the service. It is the choice of the Sugar administrator to decide how many different keys to have and whom to give them to.</p><h3 id="cf219c-078c-8827-4422-570e8a878a27_OAuth_Fields">OAuth Fields</h3><p>The OAuth module contains a number of stock fields which come out-of-the-box with Sugar.

The repair menu is available to only administrative users and can be accessed through Admin &gt; Repair. The following sections are available options from the repair menu.</p><h2 id="d07e18-2358-13a4-1538-570e8af3e8e5_Quick_Repair_and_Rebuild">Quick Repair and Rebuild</h2><p>The quick repair and rebuild is the most commonly used repair option and should be performed after significant changes have been made to your instance of Sugar. If you notice inconsistencies with module layouts or fields as you have customized them via Studio, this option is normally the best first course of action to try and correct the issue. Sugar caches files to help access necessary files quickly. This option clears out many of the cached files in Sugar which allows new versions of the files to be loaded. The quick repair and rebuild option performs the following actions:</p><ul><li><strong>Clear Vardefs From Cache</strong> : Deletes any <code>*vardefs.php</code> file in the cached modules folder</li><li><strong>Clear Language Files From Cache</strong> : Deletes any <code>{Module Name}.lang.php</code> file in the cached modules folder</li><li><strong>Clear Template Files From Cache</strong> : Deletes any <code>*.tpl</code> files in the cached modules folder</li><li><strong>Clear JavaScript Files From Cache</strong> : Deletes any <code>*.js</code> files in the cached modules folder</li><li><strong>Clear JavaScript Language Files From Cache</strong> : Deletes any <code>*.js</code> files in the cached jsLanguage folder</li><li><strong>Clear Dashlet Files From Cache</strong> : Deletes any <code>*.php</code> files in the cached dashlets folder</li><li><strong>Clear Sugar Feed Files From Cache</strong> : Deletes the Sugar Feed files in cached modules folder</li><li><strong>Clear Smarty Template Files From Cache</strong> : Deletes any <code>*.tpl.php</code> files in the cached smarty templates folder</li><li><strong>Clear Theme Files From Cache</strong> : Deletes theme files in the cached theme folder for all themes in Sugar</li><li><strong>Clear XML Files From Cache</strong> : Deletes any <code>*.xml</code> files in the cached xml folder</li><li><strong>Clear Search Files From Cache</strong> : Deletes the <code>unified_search_modules.php</code> file in the cached module folder</li><li><strong>Clear External API Cache Files</strong> : Deletes the external API cache PHP and JavaScript files in the cached include folder</li><li><strong>Clear Additional Cache Files</strong> : Loops through the cached API folders and deletes any <code>*.php</code> files as well as the cached clients folder</li><li><strong>Clear PDF Font Cache Files</strong> : Deletes the cached PDF font list file</li><li><strong>Rebuild Extension Files</strong> : Rebuilds language files, extensions, dashlet containers, relationships, and the table dictionary; this step also clears any cached files by APC or WinCache, resets the Zend accelerator, clears eAccelerator's cache, and clears XCache cached files<br /><strong>Note</strong> : These functions will only run if the associated systems are installed and running.</li><li><strong>Rebuild Audit Tables</strong> : Creates audit tables for any module that has audit enabled and where the audit table does not already exist; the results for each table are printed on the page</li><li><strong>Repair Database Tables</strong> : Checks to make sure the database is in synch with the table dictionary and vardef files; any missing tables, columns, and indexes will be scripted to be recreated as well as any column properties that are incorrectly set in the database. The screen will display any database changes that should be made. Click "Execute" to execute the script to apply the changes to the Sugar database or click "Export" to save the script to a SQL file.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/f2968b99-7b45-23c0-3e6e-55028dadf59b.png" alt="QRR_Database_Synch" width="630" height="339" /></li></ul><h2 id="d07e18-2358-13a4-1538-570e8af3e8e5_Upgrade_Teams">Upgrade Teams</h2><p>The Upgrade Teams option performs some cleanup regarding team records in Sugar. This can be useful to restore the private teams for all users in the event they become corrupted or are removed for any reason. The upgrade teams option performs the following actions:</p><ul><li><strong>Global Team</strong> : Creates or restores the global team if it does not exist or has been deleted. All users are then assigned to the global team if not already.</li><li><strong>Private Teams</strong> : Creates a private team for every user in the system that does not already have a private team and assigns the user to their private team.</li></ul><p>The results are printed on the screen as to what teams already existed and what teams were created.</p><h2 id="d07e18-2358-13a4-1538-570e8af3e8e5_Expand_Column_Width">Expand Column Width</h2><p>The expand column width option provides a fix for some limitations of MSSQL when requiring multi-byte characters in the database. This limitation only exists for systems running on a MSSQL database while using the MSSQL Drivers for PHP. This function is not available and not necessary to be run on any of the currently supported database platforms.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: We recommend running Sugar on at least version 2.0.1 of the SQLSRV Drivers.</p><p>Use the following steps to run the Expand Column Width repair option:</p><ol><li>Select "Expand Column Width" from the Admin &gt; Repair screen.</li><li>Select from the dropdown which of the following actions you would like to take: <br /><strong>Display SQL</strong> : Displays the appropriate sql commands on the screen. <br /><strong>Export SQL</strong> : Creates a .sql file containing the appropriate SQL commands. <br /><strong>Execute SQL</strong> : Executes the SQL commands on your database.</li><li>Select "Go" to perform the selected action. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8f1cfe35-7e12-f7de-11b9-55028ddded8b.png" alt="Expand_Column_Width" height="54" width="221" /></li><li>The script takes any field in the database that is type varchar, char, or text and increases the length of the field. The new length is set to three times the current length, or if that is higher than 255, the length is set to 255.</li></ol><h2 id="d07e18-2358-13a4-1538-570e8af3e8e5_Rebuild_htaccess_File">Rebuild .htaccess File</h2><p>Rebuild .htaccess File option creates or updates the .htaccess file in the root of the Sugar directory. The .htaccess file contains specific commands to prevent unauthorized access to certain files and directories on your webserver. File permissions need to be configured correctly in order for Sugar to write to the .htaccess file. If writing to the file fails, the expected contents for the file will be printed on the page.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: If you have additional lines to add to the .htaccess file, place them outside of the "# BEGIN SUGARCRM RESTRICTIONS" and "# END SUGARCRM RESTRICTIONS" lines or they will be removed when running this repair function.</p><h2 id="d07e18-2358-13a4-1538-570e8af3e8e5_Rebuild_Config_File">Rebuild Config File</h2><p>The Rebuild Config File option takes the <code>config.php</code> file in the root directory of Sugar and rebuilds it to have all default values for any options not specified directly. It first runs a check to make sure Sugar can write to the <code>config.php</code> file and will return to you if it can or not. When ready to rebuild the config file select "Rebuild". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/3292c67f-de12-0c0a-bb69-55028d1bdced.png" alt="Rebuild_Config_File" width="505" height="76" /><br />The default values for the config will be merged with any custom values currently set and will be loaded into the <code>config.php</code> file.</p><h2 id="d07e18-2358-13a4-1538-570e8af3e8e5_Rebuild_Sugar_Logic_Functions">Rebuild Sugar Logic Functions</h2><p>The Rebuild Sugar Logic Functions rebuilds the cache files for all Sugar logic functions in the system.

This scheduler will retrieve any unread email from active group inbound email accounts configured in the system. Personal and bounce mail accounts are not checked by this scheduler. If the group email account is configured to create cases or to send auto-reply emails, then this scheduler will handle those tasks as well. For more information on how to set up and configure a group inbound email account, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Email">Email</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p><h3 id="d1bca3-8799-6cf8-a5e7-570e8ad91b24_Clean_Jobs_Queue">Clean Jobs Queue</h3><p>The Clean Jobs Queue scheduler is active and runs every day at 5:00 AM by default. The jobs queue is essentially a log of when each scheduler has run. This scheduler will go through the job queues and either soft or hard delete old records in the jobs queue. A soft delete is simply hiding the record from Sugar, but keeping it in the database for recovery if necessary. A hard delete is permanently deleting it from the database. Job queue records will be soft and hard deleted by this scheduler with the following criteria:</p><ul><li><strong>Soft Delete</strong> : Completed more than 7 days ago.</li><li><strong>Hard Delete</strong> : Completed more than 21 days ago.</li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: The number of days for a soft and hard delete are configurable through the sugar config files by modifying the values of <code>$sugar_config['jobs']['soft_lifetime']</code> and <code>$sugar_config['jobs']['hard_lifetime']</code>.</p><h3 id="d1bca3-8799-6cf8-a5e7-570e8ad91b24_Create_Future_TimePeriods">Create Future TimePeriods</h3><p>The Create Future TimePeriods scheduler is active and runs every day at 11:00 PM by default. When setting up the Forecasts module for the first time, you are prompted with what type of time period (Yearly or Quarterly) and how many future and past time periods you would like. This scheduler runs based off of those settings and creates new time period records as needed for forecast data entry.</p><p>For more information about configuring the time periods for forecasting, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Forecast">Forecast Configuration</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p><h3 id="d1bca3-8799-6cf8-a5e7-570e8ad91b24_Process_Author_Scheduled_Job">Process Author Scheduled Job</h3><p>The Process Author Scheduled Job scheduler is responsible for processes associated with the Process Author business process management tool. It is active and runs as often as possible by default. The Process Author Scheduled Job will check for any active time-based process events in a pending state. If any processes meet this criterion, the scheduler will ensure the process flow continues. For more information about Process Author, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Process_Author">Process Author</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Process Author events processed by this scheduler will be run by the admin user (user id = '1') in Process History unless the admin user is disabled.</p><h3 id="d1bca3-8799-6cf8-a5e7-570e8ad91b24_Process_Workflow_Tasks">Process Workflow Tasks</h3><p>The Process Workflow Tasks scheduler is active and runs as often as possible by default. This scheduler processes and runs any time elapsed workflows are due to run. If you utilize time-elapsed workflows, it is highly recommended to run this scheduler as often as possible to ensure the workflows are executed quickly. For more information on creating workflows, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Developer_Tools/Workflow_Management">Workflow Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Workflows processed by this scheduler will be run by the admin user (user id = '1') unless the admin user is disabled.</p><h3 id="d1bca3-8799-6cf8-a5e7-570e8ad91b24_Prune_Database_on_1st_of_Month">Prune Database on 1st of Month</h3><p>The Prune Database on 1st of Month scheduler is inactive and runs at 4:00 AM on the first day of every month. Sugar implements a soft delete feature when deleting records through the application. Instead of deleting the record right away, the system marks a field called deleted in the database for the record. This scheduler runs through every table in the Sugar database and deletes any record that has this deleted flag. This is beneficial to keep the database small and efficient, but will remove the ability to recover accidentally deleted records. If you have a large database, we recommend activating this scheduler and running it once a month for performance.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Sugar keeps a backup of each record deleted by this scheduler in the form of a PHP file created in the cached backups folder. The file contains a SQL insert statement for each record in each table that was deleted to allow you to recover the data if necessary.</p><h3 id="d1bca3-8799-6cf8-a5e7-570e8ad91b24_Prune_Old_Record_Lists">Prune Old Record Lists</h3><p>The Prune Old Record Lists scheduler is active and runs as often as possible by default. This scheduler job will clean up backend database entries Sugar uses when generating export files. Such entries that are older than 1 hour from the current date and time will be removed from the <code>record_list</code> database table.</p><p>Keeping this scheduler active will help prevent exports from failing due to size limitations.</p><h3 id="d1bca3-8799-6cf8-a5e7-570e8ad91b24_Prune_Tracker_Tables">Prune Tracker Tables</h3><p>The Prune Tracker Tables scheduler is active and runs at 2:00 AM on the first day of every month by default. This scheduler will delete data in the tracker tables based on the tracker prune interval. This interval can be set from Admin &gt; Trackers and defaults to 30 days if not set. Any record older than the specified amount of days will be deleted from the following tables:</p><ul><li>tracker</li><li>tracker_sessions</li><li>tracker_perf</li><li>tracker_queries</li><li>tracker_tracker_queries</li></ul><p>Keeping this scheduler active helps ensure overall system performance is kept at optimum levels, as these tables are continually updated via common actions in the application. For more information on trackers and setting this interval, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/System">Tracker</a> section in the System documentation of the Administration guide.</p><h3 id="d1bca3-8799-6cf8-a5e7-570e8ad91b24_Remove_Diagnostic_Tool_Files">Remove Diagnostic Tool Files</h3><p>The Remove Diagnostic Tool Files scheduler is active and runs Sundays at 4:00 AM by default. The <code>./cache/diagnostic</code> directory serves as a temporary directory for data generated by Sugar's Diagnostic Tool, which allows administrators and developers to capture basic system and server configuration details in order to diagnose problems in a Sugar instance. The tool places this data into a zip file on the server. The Remove Diagnostic Tool Files scheduler will remove any of these temporary files from the directory once a week during off-peak hours. For more information about the Diagnostic Tool, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/System">Diagnostic Tool</a> documentation.</p><h3 id="d1bca3-8799-6cf8-a5e7-570e8ad91b24_Remove_Temporary_Files">Remove Temporary Files</h3><p>The Remove Temporary Files scheduler is active and runs daily at 4:00 AM by default. Sugar uses a cache directory to store files such as images, documents, and installable modules uploaded by users. Some of these documents may be large in size and can cause performance issues. This scheduler will remove any unused files that are found in the <code>./uploads/tmp</code> directory or in most user-configured upload directories. For more information about temporary file storage, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Advanced_Configuration_Options">Advanced Configuration Options</a> documentation.</p><h3 id="d1bca3-8799-6cf8-a5e7-570e8ad91b24_Remove_Temporary_PDF_Files">Remove Temporary PDF Files</h3><p>The Remove Temporary PDF Files scheduler is active and runs daily at 4:00 AM by default. The <code>./cache/pdf/</code> directory serves as a temporary directory for in-progress PDF files generated from reports, quotes, and other parts of Sugar. Upon successful completion of the PDF operation, the file is typically removed from the directory, but there may be circumstances where orphaned PDF files could remain in the directory. This scheduler will remove any PDF files from the directory during off-peak hours.</p><h3 id="d1bca3-8799-6cf8-a5e7-570e8ad91b24_Run_Email_Reminder_Notifications">Run Email Reminder Notifications</h3><p>The Run Email Reminder Notifications scheduler is active and runs as often as possible by default. This scheduler will send out email reminders for meetings and calls that have met or passed the reminder time. Meetings and calls need to have a status that does not equal "Held" in order for the email reminder to be sent to invitees.</p><h3 id="d1bca3-8799-6cf8-a5e7-570e8ad91b24_Run_Nightly_Mass_Email_Campaigns">Run Nightly Mass Email Campaigns</h3><p>The Run Nightly Mass Email Campaigns scheduler is active and runs on the hour, every hour from 2:00 AM to 6:00 AM by default. This scheduler will process any campaign emails waiting to be sent in the email queue up to the configured batch amount. If the number of emails to send per batch is set to 500, and this scheduler is set to run once an hour, then you will be sending 500 emails per hour. Please configure this scheduler and the number of emails to send per batch to allow the proper amount of email to be sent.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Many email providers place limitations on email send rates such as emails per hour, emails per day, unique recipients, etc. Please check with your email provider to ensure that they will be able to process the volume of emails you desire to send through campaigns.</p><p>For more information on setting the number of emails sent per batch, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Email">Campaign Email Settings</a> section in the Email documentation in the Administration guide.</p><h3 id="d1bca3-8799-6cf8-a5e7-570e8ad91b24_Run_Nightly_Process_Bounced_Campaign_Emails">Run Nightly Process Bounced Campaign Emails</h3><p>The Run Nightly Process Bounced Campaign Emails scheduler is active and runs on the hour, every hour from 2:00 AM to 6:00 AM by default. This scheduler will retrieve any unread email from active bounce inbound mail accounts configured in the system. Bounce email accounts are important for receiving any bounced emails from a campaign. Emails in the bounce mail account must match all of the following criteria to be classified as a bounced email:</p><ul><li>'From' email address must contain MAILER-DAEMON or POSTMASTER.</li><li>'Remove me' link from the original email must be in the email body.</li><li>The originating email does not have a campaign activity log type of invalid email or send error.</li></ul><p>We recommend setting this scheduler to run at the same time and interval as the Run Nightly Mass Email Campaigns scheduler. For more information on how to set up and configure a bounce inbound email account, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Email">Email</a> documentation of the Administration guide.</p><h3 id="d1bca3-8799-6cf8-a5e7-570e8ad91b24_Run_Report_Generation_Scheduled_Tasks">Run Report Generation Scheduled Tasks</h3><p>The Run Report Generation Scheduled Tasks scheduler is inactive by default with an interval set to run daily at 6:00 AM when activated. This scheduler executes any scheduled reports and emails the results to the designated user. If you want to utilize scheduled reports, please enable this scheduler, otherwise the reports will not be emailed. We recommend running this scheduler as often as possible, this way if someone schedules a report for 6:15 AM, they will not have to wait until 7:00 to receive the report.

When this occurs, the Sugar heartbeat information will be sent automatically when cron runs.</p><h3 id="d1bca3-8799-6cf8-a5e7-570e8ad91b24_Update_tracker_sessions_Table">Update tracker_sessions Table</h3><p>The Update tracker_sessions Table scheduler is active and runs as often as possible by default. This scheduler updates the tracker_sessions table, setting all records that have a date older than six hours to not active. This ensures any user that is inactive for six hours or more will be logged out and their sessions will no longer be active. Please keep in mind that PHP settings on the server may be more restrictive than the six hour limitation on inactivity this scheduler imposes.</p><h2 id="d1bca3-8799-6cf8-a5e7-570e8ad91b24_Schedulers_Module_Tab">Schedulers Module Tab</h2><p>The Schedulers module tab is typically located on the navigation bar at the top of any Sugar screen after selecting "Schedulers" from the admin screen.

This backend process will call the cron.php file in Sugar with some specific parameters, and the cron.php file will execute the schedulers as necessary.</p><p>Sugar instances hosted on-demand by SugarCRM have the cron scheduler set up automatically, but it must be configured for on-site instances. In UNIX systems (MAC and Linux) you can configure crontab to run the schedulers. Navigate to Admin &gt; Scheduler to get the system information necessary to set up the crontab. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/44d41e0e-905e-8413-36b8-550301d44ed0.png" alt="Schedulers_ToSetupCrontab1" width="534" height="74" /><br /><strong>Note</strong>: The scheduler is throttled by default to prevent it from being ran more often than every 30 seconds.

When a Web Logic Hook is triggered, the data is not sent instantaneously. Rather, the data is queued and processed under the Dispatch Web Logic Hook scheduled job. Once the job is processed through a regular scheduler run, the data for the record that triggered the hook is transmitted to the designated URL in a JSON format for further processing.This can allow you to send this data to other applications within your organization or to manipulate the data and transmit it back to Sugar via the REST API.</p><h2 id="d43c88-93fb-26e6-6d1c-570e8a4044a4_Web_Logic_Hook_Fields">Web Logic Hook Fields</h2><p>The Web Logic Hooks module contains a number of stock fields which come out-of-the-box with Sugar.

Before creating a new web logic hook record, a good practice is to first check that the web logic hook does not already exist in Sugar. You can locate duplicate records for cleanup using <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/System/Web_Logic_Hooks/#Module_Search">module search</a> from the Web Logic Hooks list view. Searching for web logic hooks with similar names or other information can turn search into a powerful, duplicates-finding tool. Sugar also provides a wizard for finding potential duplicates that is available from the Web Logic Hooks record view and may be used as shown below. If duplicate web logic hook records are detected, you can perform a merge per the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/System/Web_Logic_Hooks/#Merging_Web_Logic_Hooks">Merging Web Logic Hooks</a> section of this documentation.</p><p>Please note that your ability to use the Find Duplicates action may be restricted by any role which prevents web logic hook deletion.

Select the appropriate values for the following fields keeping in mind all required fields are marked with a red asterisk and must be completed prior to saving:</p><ul><li><strong>Number of emails sent per batch</strong> : When the "Run Nightly Mass Email Campaigns" scheduler runs, it will send out the specified number of emails for a single run. The default is set to 500. Some mail servers have one or more of the following restrictions for a specific timeframe (e.g. hour, day, etc.): the number of unique recipients, how many times the same email can be sent to individual recipients, and the most common, how many emails can be delivered. This setting helps control the outgoing email to conform to these restrictions. For example, if your scheduler is set to run every hour, the number of emails to send per batch is set to 500, and you have 1600 emails to send out, starting at 2:00 AM the last batch of emails will be sent at 5:00 AM. Please check with your email provider to determine the proper level.</li><li><strong>Location of campaign tracking files</strong> : Campaign tracking files log responses from campaign targets. If you are running Sugar on an external network, select "Default" to accept the default location. However, if your Sugar instance is behind a firewall, then choose "User Defined" and specify the path to your external web server in the field below. The external web server must have the ability to connect to your Sugar instance behind the firewall. Ensure that you create a file named index.php to handle requests for three different types of entry points: campaign_trackerv2, removeme, and image, and place the index.php file in the path to your external web server. This index.php file must make the appropriate calls to the index.php file located in the root of your Sugar instance in order to properly record the activities in Sugar. For more information on how to setup a custom campaign tracker page, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Advanced_Configuration_Options">Using a Custom Page For Campaign Trackers</a> section of the Advanced Config Options documentation in the Administration guide.</li><li><strong>Keep copies of campaign messages</strong> : Set this option to "Yes" to keep a copy of every email sent during a campaign. If "No" is selected, the template is stored, but not the individual emails sent. Default is set to "No". <br /><strong>Note</strong> : Storing every email sent does take up space in the database and can reduce performance. We recommend setting this value to "No".</li></ul><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/9e2163a9-b03d-8b2e-d5a8-550300ba22dd.png" alt="Campaign_Email_Settings_Save" width="513" height="241" /><br />Make any necessary changes and click "Save" to commit the changes.</p><h2 id="d59806-73b7-f5ca-3365-570e8ad182d5_Email_Archiving">Email Archiving</h2><p>Sugar Email Archiving allows users to easily archive email to Sugar records simply by sending the email to a special email address.

Email Archiving can only be activated for one instance per license key. If you have a test instance with Email Archiving activated, that service will need to be deactivated before your production instance can be activated. <br />Use the following steps to enable email archiving via the administration page:</p><ol><li>In the Email section of the administration page, Select "Email Archiving". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e9c40a03-0c36-a7b2-baf9-5503001166f2.png" alt="Email_Archiving" width="420" height="149" /></li><li>Read the Email Archiving feature description, Master Subscription Agreement, and privacy policy.</li><li>Select the checkbox to agree to the teams and click "Enable Email Archiving". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/24d45019-57b6-7965-348a-5503007536fe.png" alt="Email_Archiving_Enable" width="450" height="37" /><br /><strong>Note</strong> : Your instance needs to be reachable over the internet from SugarCRM's Email Archiving server. Specifically, the URL http(s)://{site_url}/service/v4/rest.php needs to be accessible from our On-Demand IP range, 70.42.242.0/24 (this is the same as 70.42.242.0 with a 255.255.255.0 subnet mask). This site_url value is specified in your config.php and must match the publicly accessible URL.</li><li>The next screen displays a status of Enabled and your instance's unique email address for Email Archiving.</li><li>Click "Disable Email Archiving" to turn off this feature. <br /><strong>Note</strong> : If you disable and re-enable Email Archiving you will receive a different unique email address.</li></ol></div></div><h3 id="d59806-73b7-f5ca-3365-570e8ad182d5_Using_Email_Archiving">Using Email Archiving</h3><p>To automatically archive an email into Sugar using the Email Archiving service, simply include your system's unique email address in the To, Cc, or Bcc fields when composing, replying, or forwarding an email. The email will then be archived into your Sugar database including any attachments on the email. <br />Sugar will automatically create relationships to the imported email for any stock module records that match an email address in the From, To, and Cc fields in the email. In addition, the Sugar Email Archiving service will also scan the body of the email to archive the email to records with a matching email address. Please note that in order for the email address to be recognized properly for email archiving, it must be displayed as "To: (End Client Name (optional)) &lt;(End Client Email Address)&gt;" (e.g. To: John Smith &lt;<span>john@example.com&gt;</span>) in the body of the email. The archived email will appear in the History dashlet for any matching records in Sugar. <br /><strong>Note</strong>: The Bcc field can not be seen by the Sugar email archive service just like they are not visible to any other recipient of the email.. Any email addresses included in the Bcc will not get relationships made to them from the email. <br />The following are some features and limitations for the email archiving service:</p><ul><li><strong>Meetings</strong> : If the email archived contains a calendar event, Sugar will archive the email as well as create a Meeting record. The meeting created will also be related to the matching records in Sugar via the email addresses in the From, To, and Cc fields.</li><li><strong>Cases</strong> : Email containing the case macro in the email's Subject field will also be archived to a Case record. By default, the case macro is [CASE:{number}], meaning that an email with subject "[Case:1024] Help needed!" will be automatically archived to case number 1024. For more information on how to change the case macro, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Email/#Modifying_the_Case_Macro">Modifying the Case Macro</a> section.</li><li><strong>Custom Modules</strong> : Currently, Sugar Email Archiving is only able to match email addresses on stock modules. Any relationships between the archived email and custom modules will have to be made manually.</li><li><strong>Size Limit</strong> : Sugar Email Archiving can process emails up to 10 MB in size including attachments.</li><li><strong>Implicit Relationships</strong> : Sugar Email Archiving creates an implicit relationship between the email and matching records via the email addresses on the email. This implicit relationship behaves and sometimes displays differently than an explicit relationship. For example, an email implicitly related to Beth Roberts' Contact record would appear in her History subpanel just like one that is explicitly related. However, if Beth's email address is updated in Sugar, the emails created via Sugar Email Archiving will no longer appear in her History since the email addresses no longer match. You can explicitly relate a contact to an email by selecting the contact in the email's Contacts subpanel.</li></ul><h2 id="d59806-73b7-f5ca-3365-570e8ad182d5_Inbound_Email">Inbound Email</h2><p>Inbound Email allows external email to be pulled into Sugar and can be accessed from the admin page under the Email section.

The subject and description of the case is populated with the subject and body of the email respectively. The new case is assigned to the team defined in the inbound email account record and the case can be assigned to a specific user in that team based on two rules:</p><ul><li><strong>Round-Robin</strong> : Sugar distributes cases evenly among all users within the team.</li><li><strong>Least-Busy</strong> : Sugar distributes cases to the least busy user within the team. Least busy is defined by the person with the least number of unread emails assigned to them.</li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong> : Case assignment is distributed to all members of the specified team, but excludes any inherited members of the team due to the "Reports To" structure. For more information on teams and the Reports To structure, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Team_Management">Team Management</a> and <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Users">User Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide. <br />Cases created from email are automatically related to contact and account records that match the email address in the From field of the email. <br />If a case auto-reply template is specified the sender of the email will receive an email based on the template selected. The response contains the system generated case number in the subject line of the email based off of the case macro. The body of the email for which the case was created displays below the template text. The case auto-reply ignores the "No Auto-Reply to this Domain" field if populated. <br /><strong>Note</strong> : If both Auto-Reply and Case Auto-Reply templates are selected, Sugar will respond to the sender with the Case Auto-Reply template only.</p><h2 id="d59806-73b7-f5ca-3365-570e8ad182d5_Email_Queue">Email Queue</h2><p>The Email Queue option in Admin is where Sugar administrators can monitor and perform actions on queued email. When sending a campaign the emails are not sent immediately, but are queued to be sent. Each queued email has a "Send On" date and time set by the campaign they are sent from. The scheduler "Run Nightly Mass Email Campaigns" takes the queued emails that are ready to be sent based on this date and time and sends them in batches. If an email fails to send from the queue for any reason it will be flagged as a send attempt and, by default, Sugar will not attempt to send that email for another 24 hours. Once Sugar reaches six failed attempts to send an email it will be deleted from the queue. In order to send a failed email sooner than the default 24 hours, you can perform a <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Email/#Mass_Updating_Queued_Email">mass update</a> to reset the In Process field.

Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Email Queue list view below. Please note that Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %services). This will pull up any record that has the word "services" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends. <br />For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Search">Search</a> documentation.</p><h4 id="d59806-73b7-f5ca-3365-570e8ad182d5_Basic_Search">Basic Search</h4><p>Basic search offers a few, commonly used fields for a simplified search experience.

When the Sales Stage dropdown field is updated, the corresponding probability is automatically populated in the Probability (%) field. This is a unique function to the Revenue Line Items module. These two fields use the two dropdown lists, "sales_stage_dom" and "sales_probability_dom". Both dropdown lists have the same item name for all values but different display labels. The sales_stage_dom list is associated to the Sales Stage field and displays the various sales stages (e.g. prospecting, qualification, closed won, etc.). The sales_probability_dom list is associated to the Probability (%) field and displays the corresponding probability value (e.g. 10, 20, 100, etc.) for each sales stage.</p><p>When any changes are made to the sales_stage_dom list, you must consider the sales_probability_dom list as well to ensure the relationship between the two fields remain intact. For example, if you add a new sales stage (e.g. Item Name: "review_stage", Display Label: "Review Stage") to the sales_stage_dom list then you must add a corresponding probability (e.g. Item Name: "review_stage", Display Label: "50") to the sales_probability_dom list in order for it to populate properly in the revenue line item. The two lists' item names and order must match.</p><p>The Opportunities module's Status field uses the sales_status_dom list . Modifying this list is not recommended as the values in this dropdown are tied to the Revenue Line Item module's Sales Stage field. Making changes to this dropdown list's item names via code or Studio can cause unexpected behavior. For more information regarding the Status field, please refer to the<a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Opportunities">Opportunities</a> documentation. </p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The dropdown lists "sales_stage_dom" and "sales_probability_dom" must have "Closed Won" and "Closed Lost" as item names in order for the Forecasts module to function correctly. Please ensure any changes to these lists does not remove or change the item name for these two options. </p></div><p>For sales_stage_dom list: </p><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e4561ce1-abdb-6b9c-6b8b-550300031ee4.png" alt="Sales_stage_dom_list" width="400" height="230" /><br />For sales_probability_dom list: <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b054571e-6f7b-23bc-6c5f-550300caab83.png" alt="Sales_probability_dom_list" height="223" width="326" /></p><p>Users can create similar logic for custom fields using Sugar Logic in <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Developer_Tools/Studio">Studio</a>.</p><div><p>For sales_status_dom list:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5c3e9964-6aab-fb6d-f332-55030005d85e.png" alt="dev_tools_sales_status_dom" width="306" height="237" /></p></div><h4 id="d6e185-f853-356e-1d7a-570e8a9b686c_Editing_Time_Intervals">Editing Time Intervals</h4><p>The "After Time Elapsed" workflow triggers after a specified period of time has elapsed from when a record save occurs in Sugar. For more information on "After Time Elapsed" workflows, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Developer_Tools/Workflow_Management">Workflow Management</a> documentation. When creating the conditions for the workflow, you have the option to specify the time interval (e.g. 0 hours, 4 hours, 1 day, 1 week, etc.) used by the system to execute the workflow. The available time interval values can easily be modified via the Dropdown Editor.</p><p>The Dropdown Editor contains the "tselect_time_dom" list, which allows administrators to configure the time intervals used for time elapsed workflows. To add new time intervals to the dropdown list, simply enter the "Item Name" and "Display Label", keeping in mind that the item name must display the number of seconds corresponding to the new time interval. The display label value should have the time as it relates to minutes, hours, days, etc. For example, if you are adding 2 hours to the time interval list, the item name value will be "7200" and the display label will show "2 hours".<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b887526a-0a27-f7a6-c5b9-55028883e664.png" alt="Workflow_TimeIntervalDropdown_Edit" height="193" width="288" /></p><div><h4 id="d6e185-f853-356e-1d7a-570e8a9b686c_Editing_Role-Based_Availability">Editing Role-Based Availability</h4><p>You can restrict which options are available for a user to select when he or she is editing records based on the user's role. When editing a particular dropdown list, the Roles dropdown appearing on the top right contains all existing roles in the Sugar application. The Default role-list allows admins to add, remove, or reorder options within a dropdown list. By default, none of the other Sugar roles have customized lists, so changes made to the Default role-list will automatically be copied to the other role-lists upon save. This means that as long as no role-list are customized here, all users will continue to see the dropdown options and order matching the Default role-list.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: It is recommended to assign each user to a maximum of one role. Users belonging to multiple roles which each have customized role-views may experience unexpected behavior when using record views. For more information about roles, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation.</p><p>If you wish to restrict certain roles to use a modified list of options when editing records, select the desired role from the Roles dropdown to make changes specific to that role (e.g. Marketing Administrator).<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/2f8e0798-3b11-6f41-34b5-5503005c3aee.png" alt="RBV_DD_roleSelect" width="216" height="128" /></p><p>When viewing a Sugar role's role-list (e.g. Marketing Administrator), you have the option to disable, enable, or reorder the existing options. Options cannot be added or deleted via any role-list except "Default". Drag and drop an option in order to change its position in the role-list's options list. To disable an option, uncheck the box on the right of the option's row. Doing so will prevent the option from appearing in the dropdown when a user belonging to this role is editing or creating a record. Once an option is disabled, it will appear greyed out with a strike-through. When the desired changes have been made, click "Save &amp; Deploy".<br /><strong>Note</strong>: Each role's role-list must have at least one enabled option.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/9ca576f3-b352-dd6b-9b93-55030087904c.png" alt="RBV_DD_disableOption" width="420" height="133" /></p><p>Once you have saved and deployed a modification to a role-list, it is considered customized and will display an asterisk (*) next to the role's name in the Roles dropdown. Reordering options on the Default role-list will no longer have any effect on customized role-lists. However, adding an option, deleting an option, or changing an option's display label on the Default role-list will add, remove, or alter the option for all role-lists including customized role-lists.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d32e704c-b9e3-89d3-51bd-550300409b33.png" alt="RBV_DD_customized" width="250" height="88" /></p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Users will be able to view all dropdown values regardless of role restrictions when viewing records.

Related records display in fields or subpanels on a module's record view (for Sidecar modules) or detail view (for Legacy modules) depending on the relationship type. When you create a new relationship between two modules, the system automatically creates the necessary subpanels, related fields, and metadata relationships. Relationships provide the added benefit in reports to allow access to a related records fields in addition to the base module's fields. <br />The relationships section in Studio allows administrators to create new relationships between custom and stock modules as well as change some properties on existing relationships. To access the Relationships section in Studio, select "Relationships" from the Modules panel and the module's relationship tab will open in the main panel. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/c70ea6ee-40b4-deb8-5420-5502ffd6a5ac.png" alt="ModulesPanel_Relationships" height="179" width="198" /></p><h3 id="d82820-a545-8dd9-4063-570e8ac84816_Relationship_Types">Relationship Types</h3><p>Sugar contains a few different types of relationships you can create between modules. The relationship type will determine what fields or tables will be created in the database as well as what interface the user will see when managing the relationship. <br />The following relationship types are available in Studio:</p><ul><li><strong>One-to-One </strong>: Records in the primary module and the related module are uniquely related to each other. For a one-to-one relationship between Accounts and Contacts, an account can be associated with only one contact and a contact can be associated with only one account. The relationship will show as a field in each module's record view where changing the relationship from either module will also change the value in the other module. <br />From the primary Accounts module: <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/42eeeab5-f1db-7e45-39f5-5502ff66744f.png" alt="Contacts_Field_AccountsRecordView" width="228" height="258" /><br />From the related Contacts module: <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/65ce3736-4612-c6ff-2d67-5502ffe14b68.png" alt="Account_Field_ContactsRecordView" width="222" height="164" /><br /><strong>Note</strong>: You can create a one way relationship between modules using relate fields. For more information regarding relate fields, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Developer_Tools/Studio/#Field_Types">Field Types</a> section of this documentation.</li><li><strong>One-to-Many</strong> : Records in the primary module can have relationships with many records in the related module. For a one-to-many relationship between Accounts and Contacts, an account can be associated with many contacts, but each contact can be associated with only one account. The record view of the primary module will display a subpanel for the related module, and the record view of the related module will display a field containing a link to the related record. <br />From the primary Accounts module: <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/6cf1ee92-e527-ce00-955e-5502fff23f61.png" alt="Contacts_Subpanel" width="291" height="155" /><br />From the related Contacts module:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/65ce3736-4612-c6ff-2d67-5502ffe14b68.png" alt="Account_Field_ContactsRecordView" width="238" height="176" /><br /><strong>Note</strong>: A one-to-many relationship is the same as a many-to-one relationship except the Primary and Related modules are reversed. Adding a custom one-to-many relationship to "Activities" will add custom relationships to calls, meetings, notes, tasks, and emails. This will also automatically add these subpanels to the record view.</li><li><strong>Many-to-Many</strong> : Records in both the primary module and the related module can have multiple records related in each module. For a many-to-many relationship between Accounts and Contacts, an account can be associated with many contacts, and a contact can be associated with many accounts. Both module's record view will display a subpanel for the opposite module. <br />From the primary Accounts module: <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/6cf1ee92-e527-ce00-955e-5502fff23f61.png" alt="Contacts_Subpanel" height="146" width="274" /><br />From the related Contacts module <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/ba16445b-fb9f-6a2d-a7c1-5502ffe33e4a.png" alt="Accounts_Subpanel" width="365" height="151" /><br /><strong>Note</strong>: Only modules with subpanels available can be on the "Many" side of a relationship. For example, the Product Catalog module lacks a subpanel; therefore, Product Catalog can only be selected on the "One" side of a relationship.</li></ul><p>When you create a relationship for a module, the module you initiate the relationship from is considered the primary module and the module that you relate it with is the related module. <br />You can also create a relationship between a module and itself. In this case, the relationship becomes a parent-child relationship. For example, you can create a relationship from Accounts to Accounts in order to create sub-accounts within the primary account.</p><h3 id="d82820-a545-8dd9-4063-570e8ac84816_Creating_Relationships">Creating Relationships</h3><p>Use the following steps to create a new relationship via Studio:</p><ol><li>Expand out the tree under the desired module (e.g. Cases) in the Modules panel and select "Relationships". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5f0299fb-5c06-46a6-4a4b-5502ff7fa219.png" alt="ModulesPanel_Cases_Relationships" height="240" width="195" /></li><li>In the main panel, click "Add Relationship". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/236d06e3-acd2-aac4-dc6e-5502ff17b6be.png" alt="Relationships_Add_Relationship" height="210" width="368" /></li><li>Enter appropriate values for the following options: <br /><strong>Type</strong> : Select the type of relationship to create from the options in the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Developer_Tools/Studio/#Relationship_Types">Relationship Types</a> section. <br /><strong>Module</strong> : The Primary module is set as the module to which you are adding the relationship.

Users with administrator or developer access have the ability configure these layouts via Admin &gt; Studio. Please note that the layouts available to configure will vary based on whether the module uses the Sidecar or Legacy user interface. All modules using the Legacy user interface will display an asterisk (*) to the right of the module's name in Studio. The available layouts for the selected module will appear once you open up the Layouts option. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/9f5a5803-2ef7-a425-e1bb-5502ff2a4b58.png" alt="New_BWC_Module_Layouts_List1" height="463" width="171" /></p><h3 id="d82820-a545-8dd9-4063-570e8ac84816_Layout_Types">Layout Types</h3><p>Sugar comes with different types of layouts to represent different sections of Sugar. Please note that not all layouts are available in every module.</p><p>The following layout options are available in Sugar:</p><ul><li><strong>Convert Lead</strong> : The Convert Lead layout can be configured to mark modules as required for lead conversion, add or remove modules from the convert lead layout, etc. Please note that the Convert Lead layout is only available for the Leads module. For more information on modifying the Convert Lead layout, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Developer_Tools/Studio/#Editing_Convert_Lead_Layout">Editing Convert Lead Layout</a> section below.</li><li><strong>Record View</strong><strong>(for Sidecar modules)</strong> : Record view is used to modify, create, or view the current records details within a specified module. This layout is specific to modules using the Sidecar user interface and changes made to this layout will affect the record view layout for viewing, creating, and editing a record, as well as the quick create layout. </li><li><strong>Edit View (for Legacy modules)</strong> : Edit view layout is used to modify or create records in the specified module.</li><li><strong>Detail View</strong><strong>(for Legacy modules) </strong>: Detail view layout is used to view the current data for a record within the specified module.</li><li><strong>List View</strong> : List view layout is used to view multiple records within the specified module. The list view is also used for displaying the results from module search (for Sidecar modules), as well as Basic or Advanced search (for Legacy modules).</li><li><strong>Quick Create (for Legacy modules)</strong> : Quick Create layout is used in Sugar to quickly view and modify records within a specified module without having to navigate away from the current page. For example, logging a call from the Quotes detail view will open up the call's quick create form.</li><li><strong>Popup List View</strong> : Pop-up list view layout is used to view a list of records in a pop-up window when selecting one or more records to relate to a current record. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d2bfbd74-602c-318f-9e61-5502ff706726.png" alt="Popup_List_View_Layout" width="580" height="156" /></li><li><strong>Popup Search</strong><strong>(for Legacy modules) </strong>: Pop-up search layout allows users to search for records in the pop-up window to relate to a current record and appears above the pop-up list view in the same window. Legacy modules (e.g. Quotes) use this layout for pop-up searching while Sidecar modules (e.g. Accounts) use the Search layout's configuration. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/13157d1c-a629-16a5-fb83-5502ff54aea4.png" alt="Popup_Search_Layout" width="580" height="256" /></li><li><strong>Search</strong> : Search layout is used to allow users to search for records from a module's list view via module search (for Sidecar modules) or Basic and Advanced search (for Legacy modules). This layout is also used by Sidecar modules on the pop-up search and select. In addition, changes made to the Search layout for Sidecar modules affects the list of available fields to filter for the module's list view dashlet (e.g. My Contacts) since it is controlled by the same layout as well.<br /><strong>Note</strong>: Encrypt fields cannot be added to Search layouts.</li></ul><h3 id="d82820-a545-8dd9-4063-570e8ac84816_Layout_Options">Layout Options</h3><p>Administrators have the ability to configure the various layouts (e.g. record view, list view, etc.) available via Studio. The following are some of the options available to administrators when configuring layouts in Studio.</p><div><p>Record views may be configured to display differently <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Developer_Tools/Studio/#Creating_Role-Based_Record_View_Layouts">based on the viewing user's role</a>.</p></div><h4 id="d82820-a545-8dd9-4063-570e8ac84816_Panels">Panels</h4><p>Every field on a layout is contained within a panel, which can be organized to contain groups of similar or related fields to assist in organization. Modules using the Legacy user interface will have fields grouped by default into the Overview and Other panels while modules using the Sidecar user interface will have the Business Card and Show More panels. You can change the panel header titles by clicking the Pencil icon to the right of the panel name. </p><p><strong>Note</strong>: You can have the panel collapsed by default on the Record View, Edit View, or Detail View by marking the Collapse? checkbox to the far right of the panel header.</p><p>Record View layout (for Sidecar modules): <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/42a53d57-0928-7735-1f5f-55c4d4ac13b8.png" alt="Studio7.7 BusinessCard Sidecar" width="431" height="174" /><br />Edit View layout (for Legacy modules): <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/ba5eb3e5-2070-258f-a0ab-55c4d49b475c.png" alt="Studio Overview Collapse Legacy" width="426" height="180" /></p><h4 id="d82820-a545-8dd9-4063-570e8ac84816_Tabs">Tabs</h4><p>Each of the panels (Business Card, Overview, etc.) may optionally be displayed as tabs in the layout. You can also nest panels within other panels defined as tabs. For example, if you set the Business Card panel as a "Tab" and leave "Show More" as a panel in the Record View layout, the Show More panel will appear within the Business Card tab. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/951ad9ee-ceac-7034-5656-55c4d4aafccc.png" alt="Studio7.7 Display TabPanel" width="438" height="297" /><br />Every panel listed under a Tab display type will be a panel within the tab until the next Tab display type panel is reached. So if you add a new panel below "Show More" and set both the Business Card and Show More panel as "Tabs", then the newly added panel will appear within the Show More tab.</p><h4 id="d82820-a545-8dd9-4063-570e8ac84816_Restoring_Layouts">Restoring Layouts</h4><p>Sugar keeps a history of the changes made to each layout. You can preview and restore historical layouts via "View History". For more information on viewing the history of layouts, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Developer_Tools/Studio/#Viewing_Layout_History">Viewing Layout History</a> section of this documentation.</p><p>It is also possible to restore the Record View, Detail View, etc. layouts back to the default out-of-the-box layout. For more information on how to reset a layout to default, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Developer_Tools/Studio/#Restoring_Default_Layouts">Restoring Default Layouts</a> section in this documentation.</p><div><p><strong>Note</strong>: When using role-specific record view layouts, the functionality of the Restore Default Layout button changes depending on which the Role dropdown's selection. Please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Developer_Tools/Studio/#Restoring_Customized_Role-Views_to_the_Default_Role-View_Layout">Restoring Customized Role-Views to the Default Role-View Layout</a> section for more information.</p></div><h4 id="d82820-a545-8dd9-4063-570e8ac84816_Sync_And_Copy_Legacy_Modules">Sync And Copy (Legacy Modules)</h4><p>Sugar provides administrators with the ability to sync and copy certain layouts to assist in configuring layouts. Often it makes sense for a module's edit view and detail view layouts to be identical. Instead of having to duplicate any changes made to one layout, administrators can configure the detail view layout to be synced to the edit view layout.</p><p>To sync the layouts, select the Sync to DetailView checkbox on the upper right of the EditView layout and click "Save &amp; Deploy". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/69ec8e40-3326-6487-810a-55c4d4dd4329.png" alt="Studio7.7 SyncDetailView" width="595" height="112" /><br />The current detail view layout will be replaced with the current edit view layout. At this point, changes cannot be made to the DetailView layout in Studio, but any changes made to the EditView layout will automatically be synced to the DetailView layout when saved.</p><p>Alternative to syncing the layouts, administrators can copy the layout from the EditView to the DetailView or QuickCreate layouts. This is especially useful if you want the layouts to be similar, but different. Make any necessary changes to the EditView layout, then navigate to either the DetailView or QuickCreate layout. Select "Copy from EditView" to replace the current layout with details from the EditView layout. Once copied, you can continue to edit the DetailView layout as you wish. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/580c4ba7-72cc-fc06-7bb3-55c4d4812e97.png" alt="Studio7.7 CopyEditView" width="610" height="113" /><br /><strong>Note</strong>: The copy feature is a one-time copy of the layouts. Any future changes to the EditView layout will not be reflected on the DetailView layout without performing the copy again.</p><h3 id="d82820-a545-8dd9-4063-570e8ac84816_Editing_Layouts">Editing Layouts</h3><p>You can add, remove, hide, etc. the fields for the available layouts in the module by selecting the specific layout under the Modules panel to edit. Please note that the List View, PopupView, and Search layouts have columns where you can designate fields users can and cannot see. </p><div><p>Record views may be configured to display differently <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Developer_Tools/Studio/#Creating_Role-Based_Record_View_Layouts">based on the viewing user's role</a>.</p></div><h4 id="d82820-a545-8dd9-4063-570e8ac84816_Editing_Record_View_Layout">Editing Record View Layout</h4><p>The following steps cover editing the Record View layout for the Accounts module as an example:</p><ol><li>Expand "Layouts" from the Modules panel under the Accounts module and select "Record View". The Record View layout will display in the main panel to the right.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e89b0a40-9d17-4f73-ea4a-55c4d4dfd0f8.png" alt="Studio7.7 AccountsRecordView" width="700" height="212" /></li><li>To add a field to the Record View layout, drag the field from the list of fields in the Toolbox to a "(filler)" location on the layout per your preference. <ul><li>You can also drag a field to a location on the layout that already has a field in place. The newly added field and the existing field on the layout will swap places.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/289174a4-9ad1-2817-2176-55c4d4596dd1.png" alt="Studio7.7 AddField" width="509" height="271" /></li></ul></li><li>To remove a field from the layout, drag and drop the field from the layout to the trash bin in the toolbox to remove the field from the layout. You may remove an entire row in the layout using the same method. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/c16f0199-b934-eaac-d833-55c4d4316cc4.png" alt="Studio7.7 RemoveField" width="548" height="220" /></li><li>To expand or minimize the field column in the layout, click the Plus icon (+) to stretch the field over two columns or click the Minus icon (-) to fit the field into one column. <ul><li><strong>Note</strong>: The layout will display a "(filler)" if there is no field in that location.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/57324603-503f-fe8a-1e51-55c4d49a57b7.png" alt="Studio7.7 ExpandField" width="550" height="216" /></li></ul></li><li>To add a new row, drag the "New Row" item in the Toolbox to the layout to allow additional fields or blank spaces to be added. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/c1d2c862-0228-1bf7-df61-55c4d468cea1.png" alt="Studio7.7 NewRow" width="570" height="276" /></li><li>To add a new panel, drag the "New Panel" item in the Toolbox to the layout to group different sets of fields together in the Record View layout. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5d2113a7-3613-a494-9f50-55c4d4f3a70b.png" alt="Studio7.7 NewPanel" width="567" height="303" /></li><li>Once the layout is finalized, click "Save &amp; Deploy" to preserve your changes and deploy immediately. <ul><li>You can click "Save" if you wish to preserve the changes made but not deploy to Sugar's user interface.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/729d1c56-c11f-1f9c-cdd8-55c4d49a27f3.png" alt="Studio7.7 SaveDeploy" width="564" height="163" /></li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>Note</strong>: It is recommended that dependent fields be placed below and/or to the right of the independent field in order to preserve the correct display of fields on the layout.</p><div><h4 id="d82820-a545-8dd9-4063-570e8ac84816_Creating_Role-Based_Record_View_Layouts">Creating Role-Based Record View Layouts</h4><p>Record Views can be configured to display customized layouts based on the viewing user's role. The availability and organization of fields may be altered to provide only the relevant fields for each user's role according to your business practices. When editing a particular module's record view, the Role dropdown appearing on the top right contains all existing roles in the Sugar application. By default, none of the Sugar roles have customized views, so changes made to the Default role-view will automatically be copied to the other role-views upon save. This means that as long as no role-views are customized here, all users will continue to see the record view layout matching the Default role-view. </p><p><strong>Note</strong>: It is recommended to assign each user to a maximum of one role. Users belonging to multiple roles which each have customized role-views may experience unexpected behavior when using record views. For more information about roles, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Role-based customizations to record views are included when exporting customizations from Studio. For more information, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Developer_Tools/Studio/#Exporting_Role-Based_Customizations">Exporting Role-Based Customizations</a> section and the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Developer_Tools/Module_Loader">Module Loader</a> documentation.</p><p>If you wish to cause certain roles to use a modified record view for a module (e.g. Accounts), navigate to Admin &gt; Studio &gt; Accounts &gt; Layouts &gt; Record View and select the desired role from the Role dropdown to make changes specific to that role (e.g. Marketing Administrator).<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5184624d-0ca6-e3e7-58f2-55c4d42e5b23.png" alt="Studio7.7 SelectRole MA" width="421" height="97" /></p><p>When viewing a Sugar role's role-view (e.g. Marketing Administrator), you have the option add, remove, and rearrange fields and panels. You may manipulate the layout as described in the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Developer_Tools/Studio/#Editing_Record_View_Layout">Editing Record View Layout</a> section above. The inclusion and location of fields will be specific to the role-view you are customizing. However, changes made to a field's display label from any of the role-views will update that field's display label on all role-views.</p><p>Once you have saved a modification to a role-view, it is considered customized and will display an asterisk (*) next to the role's name in the Role dropdown. Adding, removing, and rearranging fields or panels on the Default role-view will no longer have any affect on customized role-lists.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d32e704c-b9e3-89d3-51bd-550300409b33.png" alt="RBV_DD_customized" width="256" height="90" /></p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Role-based views are not available for Legacy modules' detail views or any other sidecar layouts besides the record view.

Keep in mind that the module dashlet will not automatically reflect the Studio changes and users must edit the dashlet in order to view the changes, add new fields to the layout, etc.</p><p>Administrators can easily set the column widths for specific fields when configuring the List View layout. You can choose from a pre-defined list of width sizes (e.g. small, medium, large, etc.) that are available out-of-the-box with Sugar or enter a custom width value in pixels (e.g. 200) for Sidecar modules.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: When defining the column width for currency fields (e.g. Likely, Best, etc.), only "large" and above will apply because there is a minimum width requirement in Sugar for this field type. In addition, when defining a custom width for currency fields, the value must be 141px or wider.</p><p>The following table lists the available column width sizes in Sugar along with the corresponding width in pixels:<img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/917f2a4d-0980-3917-ecd7-5502ffafae6b.png" alt="Studio_TableColumnWidths_Chart" width="673" height="354" /></p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The Search layout is also edited in the same fashion as the List View layout as it displays the Default column and Hidden column to designate fields. Only fields (stock and custom fields) listed in the Default column will be available to users when filtering module search in Sugar. In addition, changes made to the Search layout for Sidecar modules affects the list of available fields to filter for the module's list view dashlet (e.g. My Contacts) since it is controlled by the same layout as well.</p><ul><li><strong>Default</strong> : This column contains fields that are displayed in the layout.</li><li><strong>Available</strong> : Available fields are fields that will not show by default in the layout, but if the layout can be personalized, users can add these fields to their view of the layout.

Please note that selecting the Default width will set the list view column to equal the Medium width size. Selecting "custom" from the list will allow you to enter a custom width value in the open box. The custom width value should be entered in pixels (e.g. 200) for Sidecar modules. Legacy modules should be entered as a percentage (e.g. 40) of the total width of the list view that should be dedicated to the column.</li></ul><br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d87902a7-3617-0e14-373a-5502ff7d1f15.png" alt="Studio_ListView_LabelWidth1" width="338" height="113" /></li><li>Click "Save &amp; Deploy" to preserve your changes and deploy immediately.</li></ol><h4 id="d82820-a545-8dd9-4063-570e8ac84816_Editing_Convert_Lead_Layout">Editing Convert Lead Layout</h4><p>The Convert Lead layout in Sugar is structured differently from the other layouts as it is specific to the lead conversion page for the Leads module.

For more information regarding the types of fields you can use Sugar Logic in, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Developer_Tools/Studio/#Field_Options">Field Options</a> section of this documentation. A calculated field uses a formula to derive its value based on the values of other fields as well as mathematical or logical operators. A dependent field uses a formula to determine whether or not the field should be displayed. These formulas are automatically recalculated when the record is updated. In addition, when a record containing a formula's input field is updated, the formula is automatically recalculated.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: When creating a calculated formula for a Currency field, the currency symbol should not be used for a value (e.g. $100) in the formula. The formula should only define the numeric value (e.g. 100), as including the currency symbol will result in improper calculated values.</p><p>When a calculated or dependent field is created or its formula is modified, all existing records in the module will not use the new formula until they have undergone a save action. To update the existing records to use the new formula, the module's list view includes a Recalculate Value action. Admin users or users with developer-level access can use this feature to cause existing records to recalculate affected fields without having to perform an update on each record individually.

Modules can be created in Module Builder and then deployed within your instance of Sugar or exported for additional development and deployment to other instances of Sugar. This is convenient for testing new modules and for distributing a module to many different instances. Please note that only users with administrator or developer access can create and manage custom modules via Admin &gt; Module Builder. This documentation will cover how to use Module Builder as well as the various actions and options available from within Module Builder.</p><h2 id="d966ed-3133-2d94-73d7-570e8af90d18_Navigation">Navigation</h2><p>Sugar's Module Builder is divided into three main sections which consist of the main panel, packages panel, and footer. You can easily create, access, and manage the custom modules via the main panel and Packages panel. The footer of Module Builder allows you to access different areas (e.g. Studio, Dropdown Editor) of the Developer Tools section by clicking the corresponding buttons at the bottom of the page.</p><h3 id="d966ed-3133-2d94-73d7-570e8af90d18_Main_Panel">Main Panel</h3><p>The main panel in Module Builder is where you can create a new package, access existing packages, deploy a package, etc. As you create and configure the module(s) within the package, the various sections (e.g. layouts, fields, etc.) you access will open inside tabs on the main panel. Additional tabs that open up can be closed by clicking the "X" within the tab. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/59705b51-9763-f0ee-a9cb-550300ca2665.png" alt="Main_Panel_Tabs" width="348" height="94" /><br />The main panel also displays the breadcrumbs bar showing where in Module Builder you currently are.

Related records display in fields or subpanels on a module's detail page depending on the relationship type. When you create a new relationship between two modules, the system automatically creates the necessary subpanels, related fields, and metadata relationships. Relationships provide the added benefit in reports to allow access to a related records fields in addition to the base module's fields. <br />The relationships section in Module Builder allows administrators to create new relationships between custom and stock modules as well as change some properties on existing relationships. To access the relationship section in Module Builder, select "Relationships" from the Packages panel under the desired module. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b9d44d58-3b3b-37a7-04ca-550300e74b8f.png" alt="Packages_Panel_Relationships" width="213" height="262" /><br /><strong>Note</strong>: Relationships created through Module Builder cannot be deleted in Studio after being deployed. Due to this, it is recommended that relationships be created in Studio after deploying the module instead of via Module Builder. As best practice, never re-deploy the module from Module Builder as it will remove all customizations made to your module via Studio, code customizations, etc.</p><h5 id="d966ed-3133-2d94-73d7-570e8af90d18_Relationship_Types">Relationship Types</h5><p>Sugar contains a few different types of relationships you can create between modules. The relationship type will determine what fields or tables will be created in the database as well as what interface the user will see to manage the relationship. <br />The following relationship types are available in Module Builder:</p><ul><li><strong>One-to-One</strong> : Records in the primary module and the related module are uniquely related to each other. For a one-to-one relationship between Accounts and Contacts, an account can be associated with only one contact and a contact can be associated with only one account. The relationship will show as a field in each module's record view where changing the relationship from either module will also change the value in the other module. <br />From the primary Accounts module: <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/42eeeab5-f1db-7e45-39f5-5502ff66744f.png" alt="Contacts_Field_AccountsRecordView" width="250" height="283" /><br />From the related Contacts module: <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/65ce3736-4612-c6ff-2d67-5502ffe14b68.png" alt="Account_Field_ContactsRecordView" width="250" height="185" /><br /><strong>Note</strong>: You can create a one way relationship between modules using relate fields. For more information regarding relate fields, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Developer_Tools/Module_Builder/#Field_Types">Field Types</a> section of this documentation.</li><li><strong>One-to-Many</strong> : Records in the primary module can have relationships with many records in the related module. For a one-to-many relationship between Accounts and Contacts, an account can be associated with many contacts, but each contact can be associated with only one account. The record view of the primary module will display a subpanel for the related module, and the detail view of the related module will display a field containing a link to the related record. <br />From the primary Accounts module: <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/6cf1ee92-e527-ce00-955e-5502fff23f61.png" alt="Contacts_Subpanel" height="146" width="274" /><br />From the related Contacts module: <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/65ce3736-4612-c6ff-2d67-5502ffe14b68.png" alt="Account_Field_ContactsRecordView" width="250" height="185" /><br /><strong>Note</strong>: A one-to-many relationship is the same as a many-to-one relationship except the Primary and Related modules are reversed. Adding a custom one-to-many relationship to "Activities" will add custom relationships to calls, meetings, notes, tasks, and emails. This will also automatically add these subpanels to the record view.</li><li><strong>Many-to-Many</strong> : Records in both the primary module and the related module can have multiple records related in each module. For a many-to-many relationship between Accounts and Contacts, an account can be associated with many contacts, and a contact can be associated with many accounts. Both module's record view will display a subpanel for the opposite module. <br />From the primary Accounts module: <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/6cf1ee92-e527-ce00-955e-5502fff23f61.png" alt="Contacts_Subpanel" width="293" height="156" /><br />From the related Contacts module: <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/ba16445b-fb9f-6a2d-a7c1-5502ffe33e4a.png" alt="Accounts_Subpanel" width="351" height="145" /><br /><strong>Note</strong>: Only modules with subpanels available can be on the "Many" side of a relationship. For example, the Product Catalog module lacks a subpanel; therefore, Product Catalog can only be selected on the "One" side of a relationship.</li></ul><p>When you create a relationship for a module, the selected module is considered to be the primary module and the module that you relate it with is the related module. <br />You can also create a relationship between a module and itself. In this case, the relationship becomes a parent-child relationship. For example, you can create a relationship from Accounts to Accounts in order to create sub-accounts within the primary account.</p><h5 id="d966ed-3133-2d94-73d7-570e8af90d18_Creating_Relationships">Creating Relationships</h5><p>Use the following steps to create a new relationship via Module Builder:</p><ol><li>Expand out the tree under the desired module in the Packages Panel, and select "Relationships". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b9d44d58-3b3b-37a7-04ca-550300e74b8f.png" alt="Packages_Panel_Relationships" width="214" height="263" /></li><li>In the main panel, click "Add Relationship". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/bac81290-3edf-f1bc-fe87-550300fa240a.png" alt="Relationships_Add_Relationship" width="378" height="151" /></li><li>Enter appropriate values for the following options: <br /><strong>Type</strong> : Select the type of relationship to create from the options in the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Developer_Tools/Module_Builder/#Relationship_Types">Relationship Types</a> section. <br /><strong>Module</strong> : The Primary module is set to the module you are adding the relationship to.

A formula specifies one or more field values along with operators and functions that are mathematical or logical. When you execute a formula, Sugar performs the calculation to derive the value. When a field is used in a formula, Sugar recalculates the value whenever a user updates it and saves the record. Similarly, if you update a formula, Sugar recalculates the field value based on the updated formula.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: When creating a calculated formula for a Currency field, the currency symbol should not be used for a value (e.g. $100) in the formula. The formula should only define the numeric value (e.g. 100), as including the currency symbol will result in improper calculated values. </p><p>For more information regarding the types of fields you can use Sugar Logic in, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Developer_Tools/Module_Builder/#Field_Options">Field Options</a> section of this documentation.

These options can make updates to the module your workflow is tied to, or a module related to this target module. The options can also create records in related modules or modules related to related modules. The options are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Update fields in the target module :</strong> You will be given the option so select one or more fields within the target module of the workflow, and what the new value or values should be.</li><li><strong>Update fields in a related module :</strong> You will first be given the option to choose which related module to the target module you would like to update. After selecting the related module, you will select one or more fields within the related module to update, and what the new value or values should be.</li><li><strong>Create a record in a module associated with target module : </strong>You will be given the option to choose a related module to your target module. This action will create a new record in the related module, such as creating a new call related to an account, where Accounts is the target module. After selecting the module, you will be given the option to populate any or all fields with the related module. Any required fields will be marked with a red asterisk.</li><li><strong>Create a record associated with a module related to the target module : </strong>This action will take a record, or all records, related to your target module, and create a related record to this middle module. When creating these actions, you are asked to select the related module to your target module, and then select that module's related module where the new record is going to be created. For example, if your workflow's target module is Contacts, the following screenshot shows how a call will be created and related to the contact's related Opportunity. <p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/1d7d4b44-6620-94cb-6749-550300b521de.png" alt="13a" width="298" height="521" /><br />On the next screen, after selecting your modules, you will select one or more fields within the related module to update, and what the new value or values should be. Clicking on the "Advanced Search" button at the bottom of this window will allow you to select if the workflow is specific for all related records (Opportunities), or if the related record should be filtered at all.</p><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/af8e2c8a-e7b1-2ad0-7133-550300be8fd7.png" alt="pic14" width="360" height="140" /><br />The "Advanced Search" function also contains special functions for specific field types:</p><ul><li><strong>Assigned User : </strong>Allows you to configure the action to set the assigned user to be either the actual user or the user's manager who either is currently assigned to the triggered record, the one who most recently updated it, the one who created it, or is the one saving the record.</li><li><strong>Team ID : </strong>Allows you to configure the action to set the team to be the default team of the user who triggered the workflow or, if it is updating a related record, to match the primary team of the triggered record.</li><li><strong>Dropdown Fields : </strong>Allows you to configure the action to sequentially move the dropdown option forward or backward in the order in which it appears in the dropdown list.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="dd33a4-6ca2-a7dc-eee4-570e8a3141c5_Viewing_Workflows">Viewing Workflows</h2><p>There are various options available for viewing workflow records in Sugar including via Workflow Definitions list view, Workflow Definitions detail view, and the Workflow Definitions Last Viewed menu.

You must specify which of those two years the start date applies to. In these cases, a dropdown will appear prompting you to select the appropriate fiscal year. For example, if the start date of the fiscal year is 07/01/2014, the end date will be 06/30/2015. The forecast wizard will therefore ask you if the time period 07/01/2014 -06/30/2015 should be considered fiscal year 2014 or fiscal year 2015.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a2860141-1007-0824-44d3-5502ff9884d3.png" alt="fy-dropdown" width="407" height="245" /><br /><strong>Note:</strong> It is not recommended to choose February 29th for the fiscal year start date, though this is possible to do during a leap year.

As the administrator, you will specify the sale probabilities which will cause revenue line items to be initially included on a user's forecast. Each user, however, can then manually choose to include or exclude their revenue line items no matter how the probabilities line up with these ranges.</p><p>In addition to initially including revenue line items, these ranges will also be available to users in the Forecasts module as categories for filtering or for grouping in charts. Ranges which are not associated with probabilities and are used strictly for categorical purposes may be added under the Custom Ranges option.</p><h4 id="e0f893-9d55-4455-0a05-570e8a19e5f6_Two_Ranges">Two Ranges</h4><p>Choose the Two Ranges radio button for a simple include or exclude model.

Sugar stores tags as individual records in the Tags module. Modules using the Sidecar user interface (e.g. Accounts, Contacts, etc.) contain a Tags field where users can create and share tags that can be used to identify records in filters, dashlets, and reports. For a list of sidecar modules, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/User_Interface">User Interface</a> documentation in the Application Guide.</p><p>While tags can be created and used by regular Sugar users, some actions in the Tags module are only available to administrators and users with developer-level role access. This documentation will cover these administration options which allow you to manage the system-wide tag repository. For information about tag functionality which is available to regular users, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Tags">Tags</a> documentation in the Application Guide. For instructions concerning views and actions which are common across most Sugar modules, such as creating, editing, and deleting tags, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Tag_Management/#Working_With_Tags">Working With Tags</a> section of this page.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The Tags module is not configurable in Studio.</p><h3 id="e5ff5e-7b7b-1772-082c-570e8a3b700e_Understanding_Tag_Behavior">Understanding Tag Behavior</h3><p>The act of relating a tag to a Sugar record is referred to as "tagging". By default, modules using the Sidecar user interface (e.g. Contacts, Leads, Accounts, etc.) are enabled for tagging and include the Tags field in the layout. Tags can be related to multiple records across any sidecar module, so a single tag can appear on multiple records. Likewise, a single record can have multiple tags. Unlike other Sugar modules, users can see all tag records regardless of their team membership. Additionally, users will be able to edit Tag fields to add existing tags or create new tags regardless of any role restrictions their user has for the Tags module.</p><p>Please note that only administrators and users with developer-level role access may create, edit, merge, and delete tags in the Tags module. To assign a Tags Administrator role to a Sugar user, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Tag_Management">Creating a Tags Administrator</a> section of this page.</p><p>For more information on tag usage guidelines and interacting with tags in Sugar, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Tags">Tags</a> documentation in the Application Guide.</p><h2 id="e5ff5e-7b7b-1772-082c-570e8a3b700e_Tag_Fields">Tag Fields</h2><p>The Tags module contains a number of stock fields that come out-of-the-box with Sugar.

It presents all of the tasks that must be completed in a simplified and streamlined format. Process Author empowers Sugar administrators to automate vital business processes for their organization. Some examples of business processes that can be automated using Process Author include invoice approvals, lead routing, customer service case routing, and automated reminders and escalations.</p><h3 id="e87a8d-e132-65be-3f6a-570e8ac7a153_Process_Author_Modules">Process Author Modules</h3><p>In order to seamlessly automate business processes, Sugar Process Author suite leverages four interconnected process-related modules.

Once a process definition has been created, it will generate a record in the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Processes">Processes</a> module each time the process definition is triggered.</p><p>The Process Business Rules, Process Email Templates, and Process Definitions modules can be viewed and configured by any system administrator user. In addition, regular users with a role that provides developer access to one or more modules will be able to access all Process Author functions for those modules. Regular users without developer role permissions will only have access to the Processes module. For more information about roles, please review the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation.</p><p>The following image illustrates the relationship between the Process Author modules:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/eeee68ca-d305-6eb3-6222-550302806231.png" alt="pa-overview2" width="445" height="334" /></p><p>The following table describes the four Process Author modules and their intended use.

Process definitions are created by a Sugar administrator. The process definition consists of a network of activities and their relationships, criteria to indicate the start and end of the process, and information about the individual activities (e.g., participants) contained within the business process.</p></td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Processes">Processes</a></td><td><p>A process is a running instance of a process definition. A single process begins every time a process definition is executed. For example, a single process definition could be created to automate quote approvals, but because users may engage in several quote approvals per day, each approval will be represented by a separate process instance, all governed by the single process definition. In other words, the Processes module is the many-to-one (M:1) child module of Process Definitions.</p><p>The Processes module is the only Process Author module that is visible to regular users. From the Processes dashlet and module list view, they will be able to see running processes if there is anything for them to approve, reject, or review.</p><p>There are three ways an administrator can view a list of processes:</p><ul><li><b>Processes module list view :</b> List views for the Processes module display processes that require the logged-in user to take approve, reject, or review action. Admin users, like regular users, will only see the processes that are waiting for them. List views can be accessed by navigating to Processes &gt; View Processes.</li><li><strong><a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Process_Author/#Processes_Dashlet">Processes dashlet</a> : </strong>This dashlet displays processes that require the logged-in user to take approve, reject, or review action. Admin users, like regular users, will only see the processes that they need to act upon.</li><li><b><a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Process_Author/#Process_Management_List_View">Process Management page</a> : </b>This is the one place in Sugar where an administrator can see all running, cancelled, and completed processes. From the Process Management page, the admin can also monitor process status, reassign or cancel an in-progress process, or repair processes in an error state. The Process Management page is accessible via the Admin &gt; Process Author panel or via the Processes module tab by clicking on "Process Management".</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Process_Author/Process_Business_Rules">Process Business Rules</a></td><td><p>A process business rule is a reusable set of conditions and outcomes that can be embedded in a process definition. The set of rules may enforce business policy, make a decision, or infer new data from existing data. For example, if Sally manages all business opportunities of $10,000 or more, and Chris manages all business opportunities under $10,000, a process business rule can be created and used by all relevant process definitions to ensure that the assignment policy is respected. In the case of an eventual personnel change, only the process business rule will need to be edited to affect all related processes.</p></td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Process_Author/Process_Email_Templates">Process Email Templates</a></td><td><p>A process email template is required in order to include a Send Message event in a process definition.

Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the list view below.</p><p>Unlike the standard Sugar module search bar filter, the Process Management search bar will query all Process fields by default. This means that a search for "error" will return processes named "Approve Error Resolution" and processes that affect a record named "Customer receives error when logging in" and even processes that are in an "Error" status.</p><p>Please note that on the Process Management page, Sugar automatically assumes a wildcard character (%) at both the beginning and the end of your search phrase. Therefore, the search for "error" will pull up any record that has the word "error" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e5550c9a-4253-23a6-6a4a-550302acdc4c.png" alt="pm-search-query" width="695" height="169" /></p><p>The search also provides a Filter option that can be used in combination with the open Search box to narrow your search further using the available options as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>All</strong> : Returns all processes.</li><li><strong>Processes Completed</strong> : Returns only processes with a status of "Completed".</li><li><strong>Processes Terminated</strong> : Returns only processes with a status of "Terminated".</li><li><strong>Processes In Progress</strong> : Returns only processes with a status of "In Progress".</li><li><strong>Processes Cancelled</strong> : Returns only processes with a status of "Cancelled".</li><li><strong>Processes Error</strong> : Returns only processes with a status of "Error".</li></ul><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/611e08f0-4da1-4a43-bef9-5543b884705f.png" alt="process-list-filters" width="650" height="210" /></p><p>When you choose a filter, Sugar will return processes that match both the selected filter and any name provided in the "Search..." bar in the filtered list view results. For example, if you select "Processes Completed" in the Filter options and enter a search query, Sugar will only return processes that contain a match to the search query and have a Completed status. To see all processes, simply select "All" in the filter and remove any text from the search bar. You can also click the X that appears within the search bar. When you run a search using a saved filter, the search will not be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the Process Management page will automatically display all unfiltered results.</p><h2 id="e87a8d-e132-65be-3f6a-570e8ac7a153_Unattended_Processes">Unattended Processes</h2><p>An unattended process is a running process instance that has been interrupted because an activity is dependent upon the response of an inactive or deleted user. If an activity is encountered within a process, and the activity's process user record's status is "Deleted" or "Inactive" or its employee status is "Not Active", the process will be considered unattended. The activity cannot be completed unless the administrator designates a new process user.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: While an unattended process will also appear in the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Process_Author/#Process_Management_List_View">Process Management</a> list, its status will remain "In Progress" and will not indicate that it is in an unattended state.</p><p>The list of unattended processes is accessible via the admin's Unattended Processes page. This page can only be accessed from the Processes module tab's actions menu:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/4ff5e2d1-f0b8-336a-a23a-5543f94b4322.png" alt="unattended-menu" width="184" height="122" /></p><p>To select a new process user for an unattended process, follow these steps:</p><ol><li>From the Unattended Processes list view, expand the actions menu for the row that contains the unattended process.</li><li>Click on "Select New Process User".<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b9715b86-4872-fcc0-45fe-5543fe9fc695.png" alt="unattended-select" width="485" height="155" /></li><li>After a brief pause, the Select New Process User widget will appear.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a0c0362f-8d82-9d50-7c70-5543fe247655.png" alt="unatteneded-drawer" width="482" height="162" /></li><li>Find and select the name of the new process user and then click Done.</li></ol><p>The updated process should no longer be visible in the Unattended Processes list, and the new process user will see the activity in their Processes dashlet and list view.</p><h2 id="e87a8d-e132-65be-3f6a-570e8ac7a153_Terminated_vs_Cancelled_Processes">Terminated vs. Cancelled Processes</h2><p>Process Author automatically terminates a process when the record related to the process' Start event is deleted. The associated process will be removed from the Processes dashlet and the process record will display "Terminated" in the Status column of the Process Management list view. Processes may also be terminated as a result of meeting conditions specified in the Process Termination settings. For more information, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Process_Author/Process_Definitions">Configuring Process Termination Settings</a> section of the Process Definition documentation.</p><p>Cancelled processes, on the other hand, have been intentionally stopped by the administrator. The associated process will be removed from the Processes dashlet and the process record will display "Cancelled" in the Status column of the Process Management list view.</p><h2 id="e87a8d-e132-65be-3f6a-570e8ac7a153_Importing_and_Exporting_Process_Author_Module_Records">Importing and Exporting Process Author Module Records</h2><p>Sugar Process Author supports import/export functionality for records in all modules except the Processes module, which only contains running instances of process definitions. To import records into the Process Definitions, Process Email Templates, or Process Business Rules modules, the import file must be formatted as the appropriate proprietary file type, as shown in the table below. All exported records will download as the corresponding file type.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Process Author Module</strong></td><td><strong>Supported File Extension</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Process Definitions</td><td>.bpm</td></tr><tr><td>Process Email Templates</td><td>.pet</td></tr><tr><td>Process Business Rules</td><td>.pbr</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Due to the proprietary nature of these file types, only files that have been exported from a Sugar instance can be imported into a Sugar instance. For example, an administrator may choose to design process definitions in a sandbox or development instance before moving them to a production environment. For this, the files would be exported from the dev instance as .bpm files and then imported into the production instance's Process Definitions module.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Process Definitions may contain references to Business Rules and Email Templates. These references are lost when the Process Definition is imported. Even if the Business Rules and Email Templates are imported prior to importing the Process Definition, the references are not automatically reestablished in the imported Process Definition. They must be reestablished manually.</p><p>Process Author module records can be exported from any of the following locations:</p><ul><li>The individual module record's list view Actions menu:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/cda37490-4fab-3a46-34ab-550302336242.png" alt="listview-export" width="319" height="194" /></li><li>The relevant module's list view Actions menu:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/28a38cdf-4afa-123c-b596-550302e143e9.png" alt="list-export" width="324" height="202" /></li><li>The individual module record's record view Actions menu:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/234c7155-a38d-0860-5cc1-550302679a21.png" alt="recordview -export" width="323" height="168" /></li><li>The relevant dashlet's Export button adjacent to the individual record:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/6415ef1e-a528-63fd-96b4-550302e524d4.png" alt="dashlet-export" width="319" height="161" /></li></ul><p>Process Author module records can be imported via either of the following locations:</p><ul><li>The Actions menu on the relevant module's dashlet: <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a0d6fce2-ea96-8a57-dbbf-55030247183e.png" alt="dashlet-import" width="319" height="119" /></li><li>The relevant module tab's Actions menu:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/64b9bd0e-25aa-1848-714a-55030229bc5d.png" alt="tab-import" width="163" height="131" /></li></ul><p>After clicking "Import [Process Module Name]", you will be prompted to find the import file on your local drive.

In the following example of a set of rules for routing leads, each row of the Rules Builder table represents a separate rule that will be evaluated by the process. Each row is evaluated independently in descending order. When a rule in the rule set is evaluated as true, the evaluation process stops. Therefore, only the conclusions defined by the first (topmost) true condition will be returned.</p><p>The following example represents a rule set that evaluates the fields "Lead Score" and "Lead Source" to determine a return value and assigned user. The first row translates conversationally to: If the lead's score is greater than or equal to 50, and the lead's source is a Cold Call, then capture the office phone number and assign the lead to Chris Olliver.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a9623201-2e21-3584-629f-55030215dc5f.png" width="600" height="208" alt="lead-rule" /></p><h3 id="e9bc21-fe00-f5bc-5476-570e8add032f_Condition_and_Conclusion_Elements">Condition and Conclusion Elements</h3><p>Process business rules are comprised of at least one condition:conclusion element.</p><ul><li><strong>Conditions</strong> : One or more "if" statements that will be evaluated as true or false.</li><li><strong>Conclusions</strong> : The results that are returned if the condition evaluates to true.</li></ul><p>By default, a true condition must result in a Return value. The Return value can be constructed using variables, constants, operators and/or literal values. If there are to be multiple outcomes to the condition, the Return value must be specified as the first conclusion in the business rule. For example, to change the value of a given field when the condition is true, set an arbitrary return value and then click on the + button adjacent to the table header "Conclusions" to add another conclusion column to the row where the field update can be defined.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/beccda1d-5e16-54f1-254d-55030262aa7e.png" alt="add-conclusion" width="352" height="176" /></p><p>The condition will evaluate a set of given variables and if the condition is evaluated as "true", the conclusion will then return a specified value. In the following example, an Opportunity with a probability of 90% or more will return the character string, "Hot Deal".<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/65906c5f-8ab0-eaf9-7efd-5503028e002f.png" alt="condition-conclusion" width="353" height="109" /></p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Process business rule Return values will always convert to text for evaluation within a process definition.</p><h3 id="e9bc21-fe00-f5bc-5476-570e8add032f_Operator_Elements">Operator Elements</h3><p>Conditions utilize comparison operators.

Process definitions are central to the Process Author suite. They define the steps in automated business processes and control the flow of work that is allocated during running processes in Sugar. Process definitions are created by a Sugar administrator and consist of a network of activities and their relationships, criteria to indicate the start and end of the process, and information about the individual activities (e.g., participants) contained within the business process.</p><p>Before continuing, please read the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Process_Author">Process Author</a> overview page, which defines critical vocabulary and other elements that may be referenced on this page.</p><p>This documentation contains the following pages:</p><ul><li><a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Process_Author">Process Author</a></li><li>Process Definitions (current page)</li><li><a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Process_Author/Process_Business_Rules">Process Business Rules</a></li><li><a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Process_Author/Process_Email_Templates">Process Email Templates</a></li></ul><p>Additionally, the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Processes">Processes</a> page of the Application Guide contains documentation for the user-facing elements of Sugar Process Author. Please note that Process Author is exclusive to Enterprise and Ultimate editions of Sugar 7.6.x and later.</p><p>The following image illustrates the relationship between all of the Process Author modules:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/eeee68ca-d305-6eb3-6222-550302806231.png" width="500" height="375" alt="pa-overview2" /></p><p>The process definition will be the parent record for countless running processes in Sugar. Every time a process definition's <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Process_Author/Process_Definitions/#Adding_a_Start_Event">Start event</a> is triggered, a single process will begin to run in Sugar. When a running process requires action from a user, that user will see the process in their <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Process_Author">Processes dashlet</a> and Processes module list view. Users will never see the parent process definition that controls the process, nor will they see any processes for which they are not required to act.</p><p>This is an example of a complete process definition created in the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Process_Author/Process_Definitions">Visual Designer</a>:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/69ed1415-8b6a-a177-4e04-5503027db84b.png" alt="process" width="584" height="156" /></p><p>In the example above, the Start event is triggered when a $10,000+ opportunity moves to stage "Quotation" from any other stage. Every time this condition is met, the process definition will generate a new process instance.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: If a process definition will utilize <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Process_Author/Process_Business_Rules">process business rules</a> or <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Process_Author/Process_Email_Templates">process email templates</a>, those records must be created before designing the process definition.

In other words, only one Start event can evaluate to "true" for any given record. If it is possible for two or more Start events to evaluate as "true" against one Sugar record, the criteria for these Start events will be met simultaneously. Sugar Process Author does not support this type of configuration.</p><p>The following table demonstrates proper and improper use of multiple Start events:</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1"><tbody><tr><td></td><td></td><td><strong>Applies to</strong></td><td><strong>Criteria</strong></td><td><strong>Explanation</strong></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">&#9989; Good design</td><td>Start Event #1</td><td>Accounts;<br />New Records Only</td><td>Type {is} Customer</td><td rowspan="2">A Sugar record cannot be simultaneously "new" and "updated" (i.e., existing).

Instead, use one Start event with an OR operator between the two sets of criteria.</td></tr><tr><td>Start Event #2</td><td>Accounts;<br />New records Only</td><td>Industry {contains} Manufacturing</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The "Good design" example above applies a process definition to both new and updated records by using one Start event triggered by "First Update" and a second Start event triggered by "New Records Only". When using multiple Start events, join each of them to the next element in the process definition with separate connectors.

It is a moment within a flow where a user must decide if a circumstance is approved or rejected, or review a record that has been routed to them. Activities are represented by the solid square icon on the design toolbar:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/7ad5444a-5e06-c84a-0f30-55774c2342d7.png" alt="toolbar-new-activity" width="621" height="178" /></p><p>Activities pause a process until a user makes a decision to either approve or reject the record, or indicates that they have reviewed a record that has been routed to them. When a process reaches this point in the flow, the appropriate user will see a line item in their Processes dashlet or Processes module list view. An Activity form element is configured in two steps. First, configure the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Process_Author/Process_Definitions/#Forms_Setting">Forms</a> setting and then configure the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Process_Author/Process_Definitions/#Users_Setting">Users</a> setting.</p><p>To add a Form activity to the process definition's flow, drag and drop the Activity icon onto the canvas:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/ec4ef90c-221e-932d-3b20-550302a80af1.png" alt="drag-activity" width="117" height="147" /></p><h4 id="ed2a1a-a9c4-c167-74d2-570e8a7b5a65_Forms_Setting">Forms Setting</h4><p>The "Forms..." setting controls what type of form the process user will see when they are asked to execute this activity.

There are two types of Activity form:</p><ul><li><strong>Approve/Reject</strong> : This type of form will present itself as an Approve button and a Reject button on the record view of the record that triggered the process. A Gateway element must be placed after the Approve/Reject activity in order to specify a flow for approval as well as a flow for rejection.</li><li><strong>Route</strong> : This type of form should be used to ensure that a record within a process has been viewed or edited by the user configured in the Activity's "<a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Process_Author/Process_Definitions/#Users_Setting">Users...</a>" setting. The form will present itself as a Route button on the record view of the record that triggered the process. The process user has the option to edit the record before clicking the Route button.

Unlike other gateways, there is no evaluation inside this gateway; it simply tells the process that two or more flows are about to happen at the same time.</p><p>Parallel gateways can be divergent or convergent. Divergent Parallel gateways will direct parallel flows, whereas convergent Parallel gateways will receive parallel flows. The same gateway is used for diverging and converging: <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b5bc54d7-96a3-c0a7-97f8-561d8d86d083.png" alt="parallel" width="500" height="194" /></p><h5 id="ed2a1a-a9c4-c167-74d2-570e8a7b5a65_Divergent_Parallel_Gateway">Divergent Parallel Gateway</h5><p>The divergent Parallel gateway divides the flow into two or more elements in parallel. For example, in the screenshot above, the process requires approval from the sales manager and a credit check from the accounting department. If you tried to use an Exclusive gateway for this, it would enforce only one of these options (sales approval OR credit check). But using a Parallel gateway, the process can branch off in both directions at the same time and then, optionally, converge later. If the parallel flows reconvene, use a convergent Parallel gateway to merge them.</p><p>The following example demonstrates a case-approval process where, if the case approval is ignored for x amount of time, the approval gets reassigned to someone else. The Parallel gateway is leveraged to kick off two separate functions. The top flow starts the approval and specifies behavior for approve/reject response. The bottom flow starts a timer that sends a reminder message three times before hitting a change-user event.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/6410c322-e7c1-4825-653f-561db6e3f473.png" alt="parallel-ex" width="600" height="245" /></p><p>When using a divergent Parallel gateway, it is important to use the correct End-event type in your process. In the case-approval example, all three end events are set to "Terminate". This means that, if a flow hits any one of the three terminate events, then the entire process will stop running.</p><ul><li><strong>Do Nothing </strong>: Ends the current branch; prevents parallel process branches from stopping prematurely</li><li><strong>Terminate Process </strong>: Stops the entire process; will terminate all parallel branches even if there are steps remaining</li></ul><h5 id="ed2a1a-a9c4-c167-74d2-570e8a7b5a65_Convergent_Parallel_Gateway">Convergent Parallel Gateway</h5><p>A convergent Parallel gateway joins multiple streams into a single thread.

Many configuration options are available throughout the application; though, some advanced options are not available through the interface, but can still be configured.</p><p>In the root directory of Sugar, there are two configuration files: config.php and config_override.php. These files hold many configuration options within your instance of Sugar. The config_override.php file is available for you to add or modify Sugar's configuration. For more information on what options are available to change, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Developer/Sugar_Developer_Guide_7.5/API/Classes/Configurator/Core_Settings/">Core Settings</a> section in the Developer guide.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Instances running On-Demand do not have access to modify the config_override.php file.</p><h2 id="ee6033-9b06-2baf-9ef0-570e8a8f039d_System_Configuration">System Configuration</h2><p>Changing values in the config files can change functionality and behaviors in Sugar. We always recommend testing your changes on a development or test system before changing values in a production system. After changing the config_override.php file, you should perform a quick repair and rebuild from the Admin &gt; Repair menu. For more information on the quick repair and rebuild, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/System/Repair">Repair</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p><h3 id="ee6033-9b06-2baf-9ef0-570e8a8f039d_Configuring_File_Permissions">Configuring File Permissions</h3><p>Many features in Sugar require the webserver to have the proper file permission settings to be able to read and write files. At a minimum, the following files and directories need to be writable from your webserver:</p><ul><li>./config.php</li><li>./config_override.php</li><li>./sugarcrm.log</li><li>./cache/ and all subdirectories and files</li><li>./custom/ and all subdirectories and files</li><li>./data/ and all subdirectories and files</li><li>./modules/ and all subdirectories and files</li></ul><p>Sugar running on Windows with IIS will need the IIS user (IUSR_[computerName]) to have access to these files. <br />Sugar running on Linux expects the listed files and directories to be owned by the same user running the webserver and to also be in the same group. Sugar would then require the following permissions:</p><ul><li>775 for the directories listed above</li><li>664 for the config.php file and all files in the directories listed above</li></ul><p>When running on Linux, the config.php file in your Sugar instance's root directory contains a setting called default_permissions. This setting controls the ownership and accessibility to all files and folders created by Sugar. The following is an example of setting Read, Write, and Execute permissions for the Apache user and the Apache group on CentOS operating system:</p><pre>default_permissions' =&gt; array(
   'dir_mode' =&gt; 1528,
   'file_mode' =&gt; 432,
   'user' =&gt; 'apache',
   'group' =&gt; 'apache',
),</pre><p>The values for 'dir_mode' and 'file_mode' are decimal equivalent values for the standard octal values entered for permissions. The value 1528 is the decimal equivalent of the octal value 02770 and a value of 432 which is the decimal equivalent of octal value 0660. These are the recommended directory and file permissions for Linux systems.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: If the octal values are entered, they will be interpreted as decimal and will not provide the expected file permission settings.</p><p>The 'user' and 'group' values determine the ownership of the files created. When empty, your Apache settings will take precedence to determine file and directory ownership. These values should be set explicitly to the Apache user and group on your server and these values will vary depending on the Apache setup and/or Linux OS you are running. To update these values, please edit the config_override.php file in the root directory of your installation and add the following lines:</p><pre>$sugar_config['default_permissions']['user'] = '&lt;your Apache user&gt;';
$sugar_config['default_permissions']['group'] = '&lt;your Apache group&gt;';        </pre><p><strong>Note</strong>: These values will take effect for only newly created files, not existing files. If you need to change the file permissions or ownership for existing files, you must execute the changes through the file system.</p><h3 id="ee6033-9b06-2baf-9ef0-570e8a8f039d_Allowing_POP_Email_Accounts">Allowing POP Email Accounts</h3><p>Inbound email accounts are setup to work with IMAP protocols by default. If your email provider required POP3 access instead of IMAP, you can add the following line to the config_override.php file:</p><pre>$sugar_config['allow_pop_inbound'] = true;</pre><p>This will allow new inbound email accounts to be configured with POP3 or IMAP.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: POP3 access is not supported and can cause unintended consequences. IMAP is the recommended protocol to use for inbound email accounts.</p><h2 id="ee6033-9b06-2baf-9ef0-570e8a8f039d_Security_Options">Security Options</h2><p>In Sugar, by default, all administrators have access to administrative tools like the Upgrade Wizard, Module Builder, Module Loader, and Backups. The following sections will show a few different ways to disable these options.</p><h3 id="ee6033-9b06-2baf-9ef0-570e8a8f039d_Locking_Down_Admin_Control">Locking Down Admin Control</h3><p>If you are managing multiple instances of the Sugar application, you can maintain complete control over the Sugar instances by preventing users with administrative privileges from making any changes. To do this, you can lock down the Upgrade Wizard, Module Builder, and Backups with a single command in the config_override.php file:</p><pre>$sugar_config['admin_access_control']=true;</pre><h3 id="ee6033-9b06-2baf-9ef0-570e8a8f039d_Locking_Down_Module_Loader">Locking Down Module Loader</h3><p>To ensure that users with administrative privileges do not load sub-standard modules into Sugar, you can restrict the Module Loader to a specific directory on the webserver that you control. This allows you to check modules before they are loaded into Sugar. To restrict the module loader, simply add the following lines to the config_override.php file:</p><pre>$sugar_config['use_common_ml_dir'] = true;
$sugar_config['common_ml_dir'] = '/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/sugarcrm/screenedModules';</pre><p>This will prevent any admin users from loading a module from any directory other than the specified directory. Once a module is approved through the necessary channels, the module can be placed in the specified directory for any admin to install when necessary. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/60272c2c-9423-0174-0602-5502ffc450bd.png" alt="Restricted_Module_Loader" width="670" height="57" /></p><p>Another method for locking down the module loader is to enable the package scanner. The package scanner is enabled by default for instances hosted On-Demand. If you are running Sugar on-site, you can enable the package scanner by adding the following command in the config_override.php file:</p><pre>$sugar_config['moduleInstaller']['packageScan'] = true;</pre><p>When the package scanner is enabled, the module loader will check the files being loaded for various functions that could be damaging to the server or instance of Sugar. For more information on which functions are blacklisted and how to configure the package scanner, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Developer/Sugar_Developer_Guide_7.5/API/Application/Module_Loader/Module_Loader_Restrictions/">Module Loader Restrictions</a> document in the Developer guide.</p><h3 id="ee6033-9b06-2baf-9ef0-570e8a8f039d_Locking_Down_Backups">Locking Down Backups</h3><p>To prevent admin users from running a backup of the Sugar files, you can add this the following line to the config_override.php file:</p><pre>$sugar_config['hide_admin_backup'] = true;</pre><h3 id="ee6033-9b06-2baf-9ef0-570e8a8f039d_Enabling_Sites_as_Referers">Enabling Sites as Referers</h3><p>To prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF) attacks, Sugar has a list of acceptable sites that are allowed as a referer to Sugar. If you receive a "Possible Cross Site Request Forgery (XSRF) Attack Detected" message from an approved site trying to access Sugar, you can add that approved site's URL to the list of valid referers by adding the following line to the config_override.php file:</p><pre>$sugar_config['http_referer']['list'][] = 'my.site.com';</pre><p>This line will add the specified site to the list of approved sites. If you have multiple sites to add, repeat this line for each site required.</p><h2 id="ee6033-9b06-2baf-9ef0-570e8a8f039d_Performance">Performance</h2><p>If the performance of your Sugar instance begins to degrade, there are some configuration options you can enable to lighten the load on your system. The following options may cause Sugar's performance to increase, but some performance gains will come with a loss of functionality.</p><h3 id="ee6033-9b06-2baf-9ef0-570e8a8f039d_Recommended_Server_Settings">Recommended Server Settings</h3><p>Sugar recommends a PHP memory limit of at least 512MB. This value may need to be increased depending on how your users utilize Sugar. For example, operations such as mass update and imports may require additional memory depending on your instance size and configuration. To change this limit, edit the setting within php.ini:</p><pre>memory_limit = 512M</pre><p>In addition, display_errors should always be set to "off". Enabling this option can result in adverse behavior for your users. To turn this setting off, edit the option within php.ini:</p><pre>display_errors = off</pre><p>When making changes to either of these settings or any other settings within php.ini, you must restart the webserver before the settings will take effect. </p><h3 id="ee6033-9b06-2baf-9ef0-570e8a8f039d_Limiting_System_Resources">Limiting System Resources</h3><p>Sugar allows non-admin users to be restricted to how many queries they can run per action. By default the limit for all modules is set to 1000 queries. This prevents user-initiated processes from taking up too many system resources. If an operation is performed by a user that attempts too many queries they will see a message returned saying: "Error: Query limit of 1000 reached for Leads module.". To change this limit for all modules, add the following line to the config_override.php file:</p><pre>$sugar_config['resource_management']['default_limit'] = 5000; // default is 1000</pre><p><strong>Note</strong>: Setting the default_limit value to 0 will remove the query limit altogether for all modules.</p><p>In addition to setting the default for all modules, you can specify certain modules to have a different value. To remove the limit for specific modules only you need to specify the modules and the limit for those modules by adding the following lines to the config_override.php file:</p><pre>$sugar_config['resource_management']['special_query_modules'][] = 'Leads';
$sugar_config['resource_management']['special_query_modules'][] = 'Contacts';
$sugar_config['resource_management']['special_query_limit'] = 0; // default is 50000</pre><p>In this example, the Leads module, Contacts module, and any other module in the special_query_modules array will no longer be limited. All other modules will adhere to the default limit.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Setting this limit too low can severely restrict users from performing basic actions. Alternatively, removing the limits altogether may let users inadvertently perform operations that significantly impact overall performance.</p><div><h3 id="ee6033-9b06-2baf-9ef0-570e8a8f039d_Configuring_a_Slave_Database">Configuring a Slave Database</h3><p>Sugar allows you to configure your instance to pull reports or list view data from a slave database instead of your live database. Reports and list views can create a heavy load on the database, so separating out the reports or list view data on a different database or server can help alleviate some performance issues. <br />To configure a slave database, set the appropriate array in the config_override.php file:</p><ul><li><strong>Reports</strong> : $sugar_config['db']['reports']</li><li><strong>Dashlets, Subpanels, and List Views</strong> : $sugar_config['db']['listviews']</li></ul><p>Set the following values in the array to configure Sugar to use a slave database:</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Key</strong></td><td><strong>Value</strong></td></tr><tr><td>db_host_name</td><td>The host name of the server running the slave database</td></tr><tr><td>db_user_name</td><td>The user name to connect to the slave database</td></tr><tr><td>db_password</td><td>The password to connect to the slave database</td></tr><tr><td>db_name</td><td>The name of the slave database</td></tr><tr><td>db_type</td><td>The type of database running the slave (DB2, mysql, mssql, oracle)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>For example:</p><pre>$sugar_config['db']['reports'] =
   array(
      'db_host_name' =&gt; 'sugar_slave',
      'db_user_name' =&gt; 'ro_user',
      'db_password' =&gt; 'ro_user_password',
      'db_name' =&gt; 'sugarcrm_reports',
      'db_type' =&gt; 'mysql',
   );</pre><p><strong>Note</strong>: You must create the slave database and the sync mechanism to keep the slave up to date with the live database. The Sugar application will not sync data from the live database to the slave.</p></div><h3 id="ee6033-9b06-2baf-9ef0-570e8a8f039d_Changing_the_Upload_Directory">Changing the Upload Directory</h3><p>Sugar stores content, such as images, documents, and installable modules, uploaded by users in the upload directory. Some of these documents may be large in size and can cause performance issues. Administrators can move the upload directory to a different location to ensure that enough space is available for uploads without affecting the system. You can change the location of the uploads to a different folder within the sugar directory or use an absolute path to place the folder anywhere in the file system. You can change this location by adding the following line to the config_override.php file:</p><pre>$sugar_config['upload_dir'] = 'd:\upload\';</pre><p><strong>Note</strong>: Remember to copy files from the old upload directory into the new upload directory for accessibility. The upload directory should be writable by the user running the webserver.</p><h3 id="ee6033-9b06-2baf-9ef0-570e8a8f039d_Changing_the_Cache_Directory">Changing the Cache Directory</h3><p>Sugar uses a cache directory to store files (such as compiled templates, aggregated variable definitions, remote mailbox data, various cache files) produced by the system to optimize functionality and enhance system performance. These files can take considerable space, especially in larger systems. You can change the location of the cache to a different folder within the sugar directory or use an absolute path to place the folder anywhere in the file system. You can change this location by adding the following line to the config_override.php file:</p><pre>$sugar_config['cache_dir'] = 'd:\cache\';</pre><p>Some of the cache files can be accessed by direct URLs. So if you move the cache directory, you should also ensure that the URL /cache/ (relative to the main Sugar site URL) on your webserver is configured to refer to the new cache location. For more information on how to configure mappings between URLs and file system directories, refer to your webserver documentation.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The cache directory needs to be created first, or you may receive an Internal Server error. The cache directory should be writable by the user running the webserver.</p><h3 id="ee6033-9b06-2baf-9ef0-570e8a8f039d_Configuring_Count_Queries">Configuring Count Queries</h3><p>By default, list views and subpanels in Sugar return record counts. This can be convenient to know how many records were found for a specific search, but in order to retrieve the record count; Sugar needs to perform additional queries on the database. When there are large amounts of data, these queries can cause performance issues. You can disable these count queries in Sugar by adding the following line to the config_override.php file:</p><pre>$sugar_config['disable_count_query'] = true;</pre><p>Instead of seeing the total record count, you will see the current known record count with a plus sign next to it.</p><h3 id="ee6033-9b06-2baf-9ef0-570e8a8f039d_Disabling_Related_Calculation_Fields">Disabling Related Calculation Fields</h3><p>When a calculated field in Sugar users the related function in the Sugar Logic, this will cause the calculated field to be executed when the related module is updated. This can cause a cascading effect through the system to update related calculated fields. When this happens you may receive a 502 Gateway Error. You can disable the related calculation field updates by adding the following line to the config_override.php file:</p><pre>$sugar_config['disable_related_calc_fields'] = true;</pre><p><strong>Note</strong>: This is a global setting that will affect all modules. If you have a calculated field in Accounts that sums up all Opportunities for the account, setting this value to true will no longer update the opportunity account sum in Accounts until the account record itself is modified. However, if this setting is left disabled, the sum would update any time a related opportunity or the account is modified.</p><h2 id="ee6033-9b06-2baf-9ef0-570e8a8f039d_Disabling_Automatic_Searches">Disabling Automatic Searches</h2><p>By default, list views in Sugar remember the last search performed by the current user in each module. While this can be convenient, it is sometimes unnecessary. If the last search performed in a module was an extensive search, the next time the user navigates to that module will inadvertently perform the search again. This can have a negative impact on performance in Sugar.</p><p>Set the following values in the $sugar_config['save_query'] value in the config_override.php file to configure different options for saving list view queries:</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Value</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td>all</td><td>Populates the last search and executes it <br /><strong>Note</strong> : This is the default behavior in Sugar.</td></tr><tr><td>no</td><td>Discards the previous search and executes a search with no criteria</td></tr><tr><td>populate_only</td><td>Populates the last search, but does not execute it.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>For example:</p><pre>$sugar_config['save_query'] = 'populate_only';</pre><p><strong>Note</strong>: The $sugar_config['save_query'] setting is not supported for Sidecar modules and only applies to Legacy modules. </p><h2 id="ee6033-9b06-2baf-9ef0-570e8a8f039d_Using_a_Custom_Page_For_Campaign_Trackers">Using a Custom Page For Campaign Trackers</h2><p>When sending campaigns through Sugar, tracker URLs are used for images, links, and the opt-out link in the campaign. When the recipient of the campaign clicks one of these links they are by default taken to the Sugar instance that sent the campaign. Many organizations may want to use a custom page to send recipients to instead of using Sugar, or when running Sugar onsite it may be behind a firewall and not accessible to the recipients of the campaign. Use the following steps to create a custom landing page to use for tracker URLs while still properly recording the activity in Sugar.</p><ol><li>Create an index.php page on the desired web server that is open to the Internet.</li><li>Add the following code to the custom index.php page to ensure all campaign activities are properly recorded in Sugar.</li></ol><pre>&lt;?php

There are several configuration options available to ensure that long-running or failed scheduler jobs do not impede your other scheduler jobs from running in a timely manner.</p><p>First, max_cron_runtime determines how long a single job should be allowed to run. If a single job exceeds this limit, cron.php is aborted with the long-running job marked as in progress in the job queue. The next time cron runs, it will skip the job that overran the limit and start on the next job in the queue. Additionally, if the total running time of a single cron run across all current jobs exceeds max_cron_runtime, then cron will complete whatever job it is currently executing, then stop. The next time cron runs, it will pick up with the next queued job. The max_cron_runtime uses seconds as its units and defaults to 1800 (30 minutes). You may wish to adjust this number based on the typical time requirements of scheduler jobs in your instance.</p><p>By default, max_cron_runtime is not enforced on your instance. In order to enforce this limit, set enforce_runtime to true.</p><pre>$sugar_config['cron']['enforce_runtime'] = true; // default is false
$sugar_config['cron']['max_cron_runtime'] = 1800; // seconds, default is 1800</pre><p>The timeout configuration controls how long cron will wait before re-starting a job that previously failed to complete. Once a job has been marked as in progress for longer than the timeout setting, the next cron run will mark the job as failed, making it eligible in the queue to be executed by the following cron run. The timeout uses minutes as its units and defaults to 3600 (1 hour). You may wish to adjust this number based on how quickly you wish a failed or long-running job to be reattempted. Please note that should enforce_runtime be set to false or your max_cron_runtime be longer than the timeout, a job which is running normally may be set to "failed" upon reaching this timeout limit.</p><pre>$sugar_config['jobs']['timeout'] = 3600; // seconds, default is 3600</pre></div><div><p><small><b>Last Modified:</b> 04/13/2016 02:20pm</small></p></div>
