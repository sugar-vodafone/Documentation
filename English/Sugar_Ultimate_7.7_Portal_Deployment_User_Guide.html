The portal allows customers to log in and review information directly from your Sugar instance and perform actions such as submitting cases and bugs, communicating with your employees regarding the cases and bugs, as well as reviewing knowledge base articles. Please note that in order to enable the portal for your instance, the Configure Portal option must be <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ult/Administration_Guide/Developer_Tools/Sugar_Portal">enabled</a> via Admin &gt; Sugar Portal. This will enable a Portal API User in Admin &gt; User Management which must be left enabled in order for portal users to authenticate.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The information viewable in the portal can be updated and restricted by Sugar users as allowed by team membership, user access type, and assigned roles. For more information on teams and roles, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ult/Administration_Guide/Team_Management">Team Management</a> and <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ult/Administration_Guide/Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p><h2 id="d4881668-7e52-505a-d9d2-570e8eacb492_Managing_Portal_Users">Managing Portal Users</h2><p>For a customer to be able to access your instance's portal, the customer must first be recorded as a contact in Sugar. In the contact's record view, you can set up the username and password that the contact will use to log into the portal. In addition, the Portal Active checkbox must be marked in order to enable access to the portal. Portal users can be created either through a process initiated by the customer from the portal, or by a Sugar user via the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ult/Application_Guide/Contacts">Contacts</a> module.</p><h3 id="d4881668-7e52-505a-d9d2-570e8eacb492_Creating_Via_Portal">Creating Via Portal</h3><p>When a customer accesses the portal, he or she has the opportunity to sign up for the portal if they do not have a username or password. During the registration process, the customer will need to provide their first and last name, email address, as well as the name of the company to which they belong. When the customer submits this form, a <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ult/Application_Guide/Leads">lead</a> will be created in your Sugar instance. The lead must then be qualified and <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ult/Application_Guide/Leads">converted </a>to a contact. After the lead is converted, <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ult/Portal_Deployment_User_Guide/#Editing_Portal_Users">edit </a>the contact to assign a username, password, and mark the Portal Active checkbox. Once this process is complete, the portal user will be able to log into their portal account.</p><h3 id="d4881668-7e52-505a-d9d2-570e8eacb492_Creating_Via_Contacts_Module">Creating Via Contacts Module</h3><p>Sugar users can create portal users by populating three specific fields (Portal Name, Password, Portal Active) in the Contacts module. Please note that the Portal Active checkbox must be marked in order to enable the user's access to the portal. In addition, the user's portal name must be unique to any other existing portal names in the instance.
