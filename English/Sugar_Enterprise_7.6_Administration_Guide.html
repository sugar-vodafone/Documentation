    <h2 id="a-abaa-4baa-5e57-551b2291bb3f_Overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>Sugar offers administrators a wide range of configuration options to set up their account. Upon your initial log into Sugar, you will go through configuring some basic settings (i.e. Your Information, Your Locale, etc.) for your user profile. You may skip these steps and configure these settings in your user preferences at a later time. Once your user profile set up is complete, you will be able to navigate to a specific area of Sugar to perform various administrative functions (e.g. importing data, creating users, configuring the application via Studio, etc.) as well.Please note that system administrators can also set up each user's basic settings when creating a user in Sugar. This documentation will cover the various options available when first accessing your Sugar account.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2 id="a-abaa-4baa-5e57-551b2291bb3f_Login_Screen">Login Screen</h2>
    <p>The Sugar login screen is where you enter your login credentials (user name and password) to access your instance. Enter in your instance URL (e.g. <span>https://example.sugarondemand.com</span>) on your web browser to load Sugar's login screen. If you do not know your instance URL or login credentials, please reach out to another system administrator in your organization for assistance. The Admin Wizard will launch upon your first successful log in to Sugar allowing you to configure various system-wide settings as well as some personal settings. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/36475abf-5863-290c-e080-550302d57a13.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/36475abf-5863-290c-e080-550302d57a13.png" height="186" width="257" /></p>

        <h3 id="a-abaa-4baa-5e57-551b2291bb3f_Language">Language</h3>
        <p>User's have the option to choose the primary language they want displayed in Sugar by clicking the Language icon on the bottom right of the Login screen. The Language dropdown list will appear allowing you to select the appropriate language you want displayed in your Sugar account. The out-of-the-box default language in Sugar is English (US), but administrators can change the default language globally via Admin &gt; Locale. For more information on configuring the default language in Sugar, please refer to the <a href="#efc04ca-ebba-0f36-db59-551b22839419_Locale">Locale</a> section of the System documentation. Once the default language is changed, it will display as the default selection on the login screen for all user's. Please note that you will need to select the language you want displayed each time you log in or the default language will display in Sugar. Administrators can also configure what languages are available to select in the Language dropdown list via Admin &gt; Languages. For more information on managing the available languages, please refer to the <a href="#efc04ca-ebba-0f36-db59-551b22839419_Languages">Languages</a> section of the System documentation.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/f1298cad-5394-8921-e20b-55030215b37f.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/f1298cad-5394-8921-e20b-55030215b37f.png" height="156" width="180" /></p>

    <p>Team Management is used in Sugar to define permissions and groupings for users. These permissions cover what records a user is and is not able to access. Teams are used in conjunction with <a href="#fdc0792-a630-699f-112c-551b22b26707_Role_Management">Roles</a> to form a robust security model for non-admin users in Sugar. Users can use team settings on specific records to allow different users within Sugar the option to view these given records. Team settings can also be used as a form of organization, thereby separating records to be associated to specific teams for better tracking. Teams can be based on departments, geographic regions, or whatever else works best in a given organization.</p>

    <h2 id="a40-f304-eea1-4447-551b22d55799_Team_Types">Team Types</h2>
    <p>From an administrative standpoint, teams will be handled differently based on their types. From a user standpoint, all teams will be treated pretty much the same. Each team type has their own special set of characteristics that aid in defining it. The team types defined as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#a40-f304-eea1-4447-551b22d55799_The_Global_Team">The Global Team</a></li>
        <li><a href="#a40-f304-eea1-4447-551b22d55799_Standard_Teams">Standard Teams</a></li>
        <li><a href="#a40-f304-eea1-4447-551b22d55799_Private_Teams">Private Teams</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="a40-f304-eea1-4447-551b22d55799_The_Global_Team">The Global Team</h3>
    <p>The Global team is created automatically when a Sugar instance is created. Global is the default team for all new users, and every user is a member of the team by default. Global is a universal team, so any records associated to the global team will be viewable by the users on this team. The global team is intended to be available for all users and a shared team for all users in Sugar.</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> You cannot delete the Global team.</p>
    <h3 id="a40-f304-eea1-4447-551b22d55799_Standard_Teams">Standard Teams</h3>
    <p>Standard Teams can be created by administrators via Team Management. These are to be used throughout Sugar to organize and grant access on organizational specifics to your organization. Standard teams are often broken out into groups by departments, geographical regions, or duties. For example, you may have an East and West team, and also a Sales and Support team.</p>
    <h3 id="a40-f304-eea1-4447-551b22d55799_Private_Teams">Private Teams</h3>
    <p>For every user that is created in Sugar, a corresponding private team is automatically created in the Teams module. By default, the private team name is the user's first and last name. A private team name will be updated any time the corresponding user's profile is edited and re-saved, even if the change was not made to the user's first or last name. For example, the private team for Jane Smith will be automatically named "Jane Smith". If the administrator edits private team "Jane Smith" to "Jane Smith-HR", and then user Jane Smith later updates the phone number on her user profile, Sugar will revert the private team name back to the user's first and last name, "Jane Smith".</p>
    <p>If your organization plans to edit private team names, you must disable the automatic update feature. Navigate to Admin &gt; System Settings and select the checkbox next to "Prevent name changes by users to update their Private Team Name". For more information on this setting, please refer to the <a href="#efc04ca-ebba-0f36-db59-551b22839419_System_Settings">System</a> section of the Administration Guide.</p>
    <p><strong>Note: </strong>Private teams are not deleted in the same method as other teams. For more information on deleting private teams, please review the <a href="#a40-f304-eea1-4447-551b22d55799_Deleting_Teams">Deleting Teams</a> section of this guide.</p>
    <h2 id="a40-f304-eea1-4447-551b22d55799_Team_Membership_Types">Team Membership Types</h2>
    <p>Team memberships are given to users in one of two ways, either by explicit or implicit membership. Regardless of the type, membership will control what records <a href="#ec10f00-236f-9c84-9827-551b22807391_Regular_User">regular users</a> are able to see. Each membership can be granted in different ways and can constitute different functionality. Team membership is represented in the team's <a href="#a40-f304-eea1-4447-551b22d55799_Teams_Detail_View">detail view</a>, as well as the user's <a href="#ec10f00-236f-9c84-9827-551b22807391_Users_Detail_View">detail view</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Note: </strong>Administrators do not adhere to team security and therefore can see all records.</p>
    <p>Explicit team membership is forged when the relationship is defined from either the team's or user's detail view. In addition, explicit relationships are also represented with <a href="#a40-f304-eea1-4447-551b22d55799_Private_Teams">private team</a> memberships. Explicit memberships, other than private teams, can be <a href="#a40-f304-eea1-4447-551b22d55799_Removing_Users_From_Teams">removed</a> as necessary from the team's or user's detail view. Explicit memberships will also include membership functionality for actions such as <a href="#fa00ab6-358f-6df2-baee-551b22857e08_Workflow_Management">workflows</a> or <a href="#fcd07b8-244f-f746-5e62-551b22f0e223_Inbound_Email">inbound email</a>.</p>
    <p>Implicit team membership is used for record visibility. Implicit membership relies on the "Reports To" field in the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/01_Getting_Started#User_Profile">User Profile</a>. When one user reports to another, the hierarchy of the "Reports To" field is kept in tact. The user being reported to will inherit the team membership of the subordinate user and be able to see any records on both his or her own team, and the teams of which the subordinate user is a member. The subordinate's teams can either be explicit or implicit teams in this scenario.</p>
    <p><strong>Note: </strong>Implicit relationships cannot be removed, but the cause for their relationship can be broken by changing the reporting hierarchy.</p>
    <p>In the Team's detail view, the user's subpanel will showcase which relationships are explicit and which are implicit. In the "Membership" column of the Users subpanel, the user will either be marked as a "Member", meaning that they are an explicit member, or "Member Reports-to", meaning they are an implicit member. In addition, the users marked with the "Member Reports-to" will not include an "Unlink" button, as they have another user (or users) reporting to them on this team.</p>

    <h2 id="a40-f304-eea1-4447-551b22d55799_Creating_Teams">Creating Teams</h2>
    <p>There are two methods that can be used to create teams in Sugar. These are via the Teams module tab's action list or by duplicating an existing team and then editing it. After initially creating the team, the administrator will need to associate users to the <a href="#a40-f304-eea1-4447-551b22d55799_Adding_Users_to_Teams_Via_Teams_Module">newly created team</a>.</p>
    <p>For information on creating Private Teams, please review the <a href="#a40-f304-eea1-4447-551b22d55799_Repairing_Teams">Repairing Teams</a> section of this documentation.</p>

    <p>The most common way to create a new team is via the Create Team option in the Team Management <a href="#a40-f304-eea1-4447-551b22d55799_Teams_Module_Tab">module tab</a>. This opens up the edit view layout which allows you to enter in all the relevant information for the team.</p>
    <p>Use the following steps to create a team via Team Management:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Navigate to Admin &gt; Team Management.</li>
        <li>The Teams list view will open displaying all existing teams that are currently available. Hover over the "Teams" module tab that is now available and click on "Create Team".

    <p>You can also create a new team by duplicating an existing team. The duplicate option is useful if the team you are creating has a similar set of members or a similar description to an existing team</p>
    <p>Use the following steps to create a team by duplicating an existing record:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Navigate to a team record's detail view.</li>

This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %Administrator).

    <p>If a team record is invalid or is no longer being used in your organization's Sugar instance, it may be deleted from either the Teams detail view or list view. Deleting via the detail view allows you to delete a single record while the list view allows for mass deleting multiple records at once. Deleting team records will not delete any related user records and will only remove the relationship.</p>
    <p>The exception to this is found when trying to delete any <a href="#a40-f304-eea1-4447-551b22d55799_Private_Teams">private teams</a>. Private teams are only able to be deleted when the user that the team is for has been deleted. To delete a private team, first delete the user via the user's detail view, following the steps from <a href="#ec10f00-236f-9c84-9827-551b22807391_Deleting_Users">User Management</a>.</p>

If the IP address of a user changes in mid-session, Sugar will log them out and force them to log back in for security reasons. <br /><strong>Note</strong>: Some high availability systems, VPNs, and switching Wi-Fi and wired connections may change IP addresses and thus cause your users to be logged out when they have not changed their configuration.</li>
    <li><strong>Log slow queries</strong> : Select this option to log queries that take longer than the slow query time threshold. This is useful for performance debugging. <br /><strong>Note</strong>: There is an inherent overhead to logging slow queries. If the threshold is set too low, you may cause performance issues.</li>
    <li><strong>Maximum upload size</strong> : Specifies the maximum file size in bytes that is allowed to be uploaded to Sugar. This setting affects images, import files, attachments, and module uploads. <br /><strong>Note</strong>: The file upload size is also dependent on the php.ini upload_max_filesize and post_max_size directives.</li>
    <li><strong>Portal Session Timeout</strong> : The maximum time in seconds of inactivity for a Sugar Portal session. The session will timeout and the customer will be logged out when the time limit is reached with no activity.<br /><strong>Note</strong>: This value is only used for legacy versions of Sugar Portal available in 6.5 and older.</li>
    <li><strong>vCal Updates Time Period</strong> : Determines the number of months the Free/Busy data is published to vCal. Specify the number of months in advance of the current date that Free/Busy information for calls and meetings to be published. To turn Free/Busy publishing off, enter "0". The maximum is 12 months.</li>
    <li><strong>Log memory usage</strong> : Select this option to log memory usage per action performed in Sugar. The data will be stored in the ./memory_usage.log file.</li>
    <li><strong>Slow query time threshold (msec)</strong> : Specify a threshold in milliseconds to begin logging slow queries at. If "Log slow queries" is selected, queries that take longer than the threshold to process will be logged. If you have enabled the Tracker Queries option on the <a href="#efc04ca-ebba-0f36-db59-551b22839419_Tracker">Tracker</a> page, you can run the pre-defined Slow Queries report to view slow queries.</li>
    <li><strong>Display stack trace of errors</strong> : Select this option to display where errors occur in the application's stack trace. This option is for debugging purposes and should not be left on in a production instance.</li>
    <li><strong>Developer Mode</strong> : Select this option to disable caching to immediately view changes made to language, vardefs, and template files. This option is for debugging purposes and should not be left on in a production instance.</li>
    <li><strong>Import - Maximum Number of Rows</strong> : Specify how many rows are allowed within import files. If the number of rows in an import file exceeds this number, the user will be alerted. If no number or zero is entered, an unlimited number of rows are allowed. <br /><strong>Note</strong>: Header rows count towards the total number of rows in the import file.</li>
    <li><strong>Prevent name changes by users to update their Private Team Name</strong> : Select this option if private team names may be different from the user's first and last name. By default, Sugar will update a private team name to [Firstname Lastname] any time the corresponding user's profile is edited and re-saved, even if the change was not made to the user's first or last name. Enable this option to ensure that edited private team names do not revert to the system default.</li>

<h3 id="efc04ca-ebba-0f36-db59-551b22839419_Logger_Settings">Logger Settings</h3>
<p>Sugar comes with a built-in logging system to log information or errors that occur in the application. By default, the logs are written to sugarcrm.log in the Sugar root directory. If a problem arises, you can refer to the log file for information that may help in troubleshooting the issue. The Logger Settings panel consists of a group of settings that affect the Sugar logs.</p>
<p>Use the following settings to configure the different aspects of Sugar logging:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Log File Name</strong> : Specify a name for the log file. Defaults to sugarcrm.</li>
    <li><strong>Maximum log size</strong> : Specify the maximum size of the log file in megabytes (MB). The default is 10MB. Once a log file reaches the specified size it is renamed to have an incrementing number and a new file will be created to contain new logs.</li>
    <li><strong>Log Level</strong> : Select the event level that you want to capture in the log file. The levels are listed below in order of the most log records to the least. The default level is fatal. <br /><strong>debug</strong> : Logs events that help in debugging the application. <br /><strong>info </strong>: Logs informational messages. <br /><strong>warn </strong>: Logs potentially harmful events. <br /><strong>error </strong>: Logs error events in the application. <br /><strong>fatal </strong>: Logs severe error events that leads the application to abort. <br /><strong>security</strong> : Logs events that may compromise the security of the application. <br /><strong>off</strong> : The logger will not log any events. <br />When specifying a logging level, the system will create log files for the specified level as well as higher levels. For example, if you select "error", the system creates log files for "error", "fatal", and "security". <br /><strong>Note</strong>: There is an inherit overhead to logging. If the log level is set too high, you may cause performance issues. "info" and "debug" settings are not recommended to be used continuously in a production environment.</li>
    <li><strong>Extension</strong> : Specify the fie extension for the log file. Defaults to .log.</li>
    <li><strong>Default date format</strong> : The date format for the log file. This format must be supported by <a href="http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.strftime.php">strftime</a>. Defaults to %c.</li>
    <li><strong>Maximum number of logs (before rolling)</strong> : The maximum number of log files to save. When the number of log files exceed this limit, Sugar deletes the log file that was created first. Defaults to 10.</li>
    <li><strong>Append after filename</strong> : Select a time period from the dropdown list to append to the file name (None, Month_Year, Day_Month, Month_Day_Year). This makes it easier to identify the log that you want to view.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="efc04ca-ebba-0f36-db59-551b22839419_Updating_Conversion_Rates">Updating Conversion Rates</h2>
<p>Users may use the currencies defined in Admin &gt; Currencies when populating any currency amount field in stock or custom modules. When doing so, the exchange rate for the selected currency is stored on the record itself. The conversion rate stored on each record will update to match the current rate specified in Admin &gt; Currencies under the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The record undergoes a save event (e.g., mass update, manual save, etc.) and the record's currency has a different conversion rate defined in Admin &gt; Currencies than is currently saved in the opportunity.</li>
    <li>An administrator updates the currency exchange rate under Admin &gt; Currencies. This will trigger a scheduled job which updates all records saved with that currency to the new rate.</li>
</ul>
<p>To keep amounts relevent to closed business historically accurate, opportunity and quote records will not update if they are in a closed status. For more information about updating opportunity currency rates, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/13_Opportunities">Opportunities</a> documentation in the application guide.

When enabling modules and full text searching is enabled, you will need to perform a system index before the module will appear in the search results.</p>
<p>Please note that only modules enabled for Full Text Search can be referenced in user posts on the activity stream. For more information on referencing record's in posts, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/02_User_Interface/05_Activity_Streams/#Referencing_Users_and_Records">Activity Stream</a> documentation in the Application guide.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Global Search, on Sugar installations running on Oracle, is case-sensitive by default. To change this, add the following line to the config_override.php file:</p><pre>$sugar_config['oracle_enable_ci'] = true;</pre>
<h3 id="efc04ca-ebba-0f36-db59-551b22839419_Activating_Full_Text_Search">Activating Full Text Search</h3>
<p>Beginning with version 6.5.0 of Sugar, global search is enabled with full text searching abilities utilizing the elasticsearch engine. Full text search (FTS) allows users to search throughout all fields and modules for an enhanced search experience. Please note that elasticsearch is required to be set up when installing Sugar for On-Site instances and it is automatically enabled by default for On-Demand instances.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to configure full text search via Admin &gt; Search:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The ElasticSearch server is selected by default for the System Type field.
        <ul>
            <li>For more information on elasticsearch, please refer to <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">www.elasticsearch.org</a>.</li>

    <li>If the connection was successful, click "Save" to preserve your changes.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/bb700900-aee1-1e40-94ee-550301c27fab.png" alt="" width="397" height="184" /></li>
</ol>
<p>Each enabled module has a set of fields that are enabled for full text searching by default. Administrators can enable or disable specific fields for full text search through Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on how to enable or disable fields for full text search through Studio, please refer to the <a href="#f610ecf-f285-110a-1ef5-551b2291c5d7_14e9e048-86c8-14a4-12ba-55b99e8774da_Fields">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Once a new module or field is added to full text search, you must perform a system index before that item will be included in the full text results.</p>
<h3 id="efc04ca-ebba-0f36-db59-551b22839419_Indexing_Full_Text_Search">Indexing Full Text Search</h3>
<p>Full text search relies on an index of the records and data to be able to quickly locate results. After enabling full text search, or enabling a module or field, you should perform a full index of your system.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: System performance can be affected while you are running an index. It is recommended to run an index during low usage or off hours.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to perform a full system index:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click "Schedule System Index". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/c509d99a-0a65-4936-e704-550301f5eb5f.png" alt="" width="387" height="179" /></li>
    <li>A pop-up message will display warning of potential performance issues during the index. Click "Ok" to proceed.</li>
    <li>Select one or more modules to perform the index on. You may also select "All" to index all full text search enabled modules. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/395731e2-16ce-aca5-314d-55028dd297e6.png" alt="" width="260" height="340" /></li>
    <li>Select the checkbox to delete the current index data before the index operation runs. If this is the first index being ran on the system, you do not need to select this option. If you have added fields to a module's index, then this checkbox should be selected or the new field may not show in the results.</li>
    <li>Select "Index" to schedule the index.</li>
    <li>The next time the scheduler runs, it will rebuild the index based on the selected options. For more information about the schedulers, please refer to the <a href="#f2906be-c8c9-5eea-7952-551b229a6790_Schedulers">Schedulers</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The time and resources it takes to perform a index is directly proportional to the number of modules selected for the indexing. It is recommended that you choose only the modules that require indexing and perform the index during low usage or off hours.</p>
<h2 id="efc04ca-ebba-0f36-db59-551b22839419_Connectors">Connectors</h2>
<p>The connector settings page allows administrators to configure and manage the various types of connectors to external data sources which integrate with Sugar. A number of different connectors (e.g., Twitter, Citrix GoToMeetings, etc.) come out-of-the-box with Sugar and are enabled by default to allow users to easily view external data via their instance.</p>

<p>For the Twitter and D&amp;B tabs, click the Test Connector button on the bottom left of the screen to confirm that the data source is configured correctly. Please note that Sugar's WebEx integration is configured via the External Accounts tab of the user's profile. Since WebEx does not have global properties to configure, it will not appear on the Set Connector Properties page. For more information on configuring the WebEx application, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/01_Getting_Started/#External_Accounts_Tab">Getting Started</a> documentation in the Application guide.</p>
<h3 id="efc04ca-ebba-0f36-db59-551b22839419_Enabling_Connectors">Enabling Connectors</h3>
<p>In order to utilize the connectors in Sugar, administrators should ensure that they are enabled properly. Please note that certain connectors are enabled for the entire application while some allow you to enable specific modules for the connector. To specify which modules are enabled for each connector, click the Enable Connectors button on the Connector Settings page. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/6ce4ad3f-ec9a-3df8-5d4f-55028d8dc3b3.png" alt="" width="267" height="74" /><br />The Enable Connectors page will display a tab for each connector that is available in your Sugar instance. To enable a specific module for the connector, simply drag and drop the desired module from the Disabled column to the Enabled column. Click "Save" to preserve you changes. <br /><br />Please note that you can enable the connector for any modules (e.g., Accounts, Contacts, etc.) that have a standard record view (for Sidecar modules) or detail view (for Legacy modules) layout in Sugar. For example, the Knowledge Base module does not have a record view layout, so it will not appear as an available module when configuring the Twitter connector.<img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e8fa93b9-0c94-a82a-dfdf-5503014a9fba.png" alt="" width="503" height="394" /></p>
<h3 id="efc04ca-ebba-0f36-db59-551b22839419_Mapping_Connector_Fields">Mapping Connector Fields</h3>
<p>Some connectors query external services based on fields in Sugar. These mappings can be customized to use different fields based on your organizations needs. To configure the field mappings, simply click the Map Connector Fields button on the Connector Settings page. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/ee56cb23-13a7-8e46-79a5-55028d13d083.png" alt="" width="267" height="74" /></p>
<p>The Map Connector Fields page has a tab for each connector that has field mappings available. Each of the enabled module(s) will display the connector fields and will need to have the corresponding Sugar field selected from the dropdown list. If the connector is enabled for multiple modules, be sure to select the proper fields for each module. Once the field mapping is set up properly, click "Save" to preserve your changes.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/65320ee7-591b-654e-12c6-5503013c7d8c.png" alt="" width="430" height="333" /><br />Please note that the connector fields may not always match up with a stock field in Sugar. If you wish to capture and map certain fields from the connector to Sugar, you will need to create new fields via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on how to create fields in Studio, please refer to the <a href="#f610ecf-f285-110a-1ef5-551b2291c5d7_Creating_Fields">Studio</a> documentation.</p>
<p>The following fields are available from the default connector mappings:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Connector</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Fields</strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Twitter</td>
            <td>Twitter Username</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>The field mapping for Twitter is used to look up and pull the information based on the value in the specific Sugar field. For example, if the Twitter connector is mapped to a custom field (New Twitter field) with a valid Twitter ID, then it will pull the feeds associated to that ID to the Twitter dashlet. Please note that mapping the Twitter username to the Name field will not always result in a match, so it is recommended that you map to a field containing the Twitter ID in the record view. For more information on how to use the Twitter connecter, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/02_User_Interface/#Twitter_Connector">Twitter Connector</a> section in the User Interface documentation of the Application guide.</p>
<h3 id="efc04ca-ebba-0f36-db59-551b22839419_Managing_Connector_Search">Managing Connector Search</h3>
<p>Connectors that have multiple fields for mapping need to specify which fields are to be used when searching for data in the module. To designate the connector fields for search, click the Manage Connector Search button on the Connector Settings page. Please note that there are no connectors which come out-of-the-box with Sugar that have search fields defined, so no connectors will be available to configure on this page. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/657b2234-b02b-2ce8-e628-55028d9bbd38.png" alt="" width="267" height="74" /><br />The Manage Connector Search page will normally display a tab for every connector that needs connector fields defined for search. The available search fields are limited to the input parameters of the connector being used. To enable a field for search, simply drag and drop the desired field from the Available column to the Default column. Once the necessary field(s) have been selected, click "Save" to preserve your changes.</p>
<h2 id="efc04ca-ebba-0f36-db59-551b22839419_OAuth_Keys">OAuth Keys</h2>
<p>OAuth is an open standard for authorization that enables users to share private resources stored on one site with another site without divulging personal credentials such as user name and password. OAuth works with a public consumer key and a private consumer key. Together, these keys identify which application connects to the service. It is the choice of the Sugar administrator to decide how many different keys to have and whom to give them to.</p>
<h3 id="efc04ca-ebba-0f36-db59-551b22839419_OAuth_Fields">OAuth Fields</h3>
<p>The OAuth module contains a number of stock fields which come out-of-the-box with Sugar. The below definitions are suggested meanings for the fields, but the fields can be leveraged differently to best meet your organization's needs.</p>

For steps to complete an on-site upgrade using the wizard, please refer to the Upgrading section of the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Installation_and_Upgrade_Guide">Installation and Upgrade Guide</a>.</p>
<h2 id="efc04ca-ebba-0f36-db59-551b22839419_Backups">Backups</h2>
<p>Backups allow administrators to easily backup the file system in their instance of Sugar. Please note that the Backups option is only available for On-Site instances as SugarCRM manages backups for On-Demand instances. Keep in mind that performing a backup will backup only the web files and you should perform database backups on a regular basis per the instructions from your database vendor.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to back up the web files for your Sugar instance:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to the Administration page and select "Backups" under the System section.</li>
    <li>Enter a path in the Directory field to create the backup file in for Sugar. This directory must be writable by Sugar and the path needs to be fully qualified.
        <ul>
            <li>Please do not specify a path that points to any directory contained by the Sugar instance location on your server. Doing this will continue to increase the size of the backups as previous backup archives will accumulate into the most current backup.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Enter a filename to use for the backup file.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Note</strong>: The filename should end with a .zip.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Once the settings have been entered, click "Confirm Settings". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/4e2be798-6481-96f7-0b68-550301a43cbc.png" alt="" height="161" width="320" /></li>
</ol>
<p>The settings are confirmed by verifying that the directory can be written to and the filename does not already exist. Once the settings are confirmed, click "Run Backup". Please note that the backup can take some time depending on the size of your Sugar instance and will display a message once complete.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the backup fails to complete and your instance is hosted on-site, please evaluate your server error logs to determine the cause. If the failure is due to insufficient PHP settings, you can increase the max_execution_time setting by editing php.ini and restarting your webserver.</p>

<h3 id="efc04ca-ebba-0f36-db59-551b22839419_Enabling_Offline_Mobile_Access">Enabling Offline Mobile Access</h3>
<p>You can also allow mobile offline capabilities for your instance in SugarCRM Mobile by marking the Offline enabled checkbox in Admin &gt; Mobile. Enabling offline access allows the user's mobile device to cache records for offline viewing as well as buffer changes they make to records while offline. The changes made will be synced once they are reconnected. Please note that the offline option must be enabled in Sugar first before users can enable the offline mode on their devices. For more information on enabling offline in mobile devices, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/02_Mobile_Solutions/SugarCRM_Mobile">SugarCRM Mobile User Guide</a> for your specific mobile device type (iPhone, Android). <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/7cf3c007-2791-5646-b6bf-550301fa3b45.png" alt="" width="416" height="389" /></p>

<div>
    <h2 id="f0a0c07-1c8b-6620-8edc-551b22dd6372_Overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>The repair functions in Sugar allow administrators to perform common maintenance routines on their instance of Sugar. The repair menu is available to only administrative users and can be accessed through Admin &gt; Repair. The following sections are available options from the repair menu.</p>
    <h2 id="f0a0c07-1c8b-6620-8edc-551b22dd6372_Quick_Repair_and_Rebuild">Quick Repair and Rebuild</h2>
    <p>The quick repair and rebuild is the most commonly used repair option and should be performed after significant changes have been made to your instance of Sugar. If you notice inconsistencies with module layouts or fields as you have customized them via Studio, this option is normally the best first course of action to try and correct the issue. Sugar caches files to help access necessary files quickly. This option clears out many of the cached files in Sugar which allows new versions of the files to be loaded. The quick repair and rebuild option performs the following actions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Clear Vardefs From Cache</strong> : Deletes any *vardefs.php file in the cached modules folder.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear Language Files From Cache</strong> : Deletes any {Module Name}.lang.php file in the cached modules folder.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear Template Files From Cache</strong> : Deletes any .tpl files in the cached modules folder.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear JavaScript Files From Cache</strong> : Deletes any *.js files in the cached modules folder.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear JavaScript Language Files From Cache</strong> : Deletes any *.js files in the cached jsLanguage folder.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear Dashlet Files From Cache</strong> : Deletes any *.php files in the cached dashlets folder.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear Sugar Feed Files From Cache</strong> : Deletes the Sugar Feed files in cached modules folder.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear Smarty Template Files From Cache</strong> : Deletes any *.tpl.php files in the cached smarty templates folder.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear Theme Files From Cache</strong> : Deletes theme files in the cached theme folder for all themes in Sugar.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear XML Files From Cache</strong> : Deletes any *.xml files in the cached xml folder.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear Search Files From Cache</strong> : Deletes the unified_search_modules.php file in the cached module folder.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear External API Cache Files</strong> : Deletes the external API cache PHP and JavaScript files in the cached include folder.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear Additional Cache Files</strong> : Loops through the cached API folders and deletes any *.php files as well as the cached clients folder.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear PDF Font Cache Files</strong> : Deletes the cached PDF font list file.</li>
        <li><strong>Rebuild Extension Files</strong> : Rebuilds language files, extensions, dashlet containers, relationships, and the table dictionary. This step also clears any cached files by APC or WinCache, resets the Zend accelerator, clears eAccelerator's cache, and clears XCache cached files. <br /><strong>Note</strong> : These functions will only run if the associated systems are installed and running.</li>
        <li><strong>Rebuild Audit Tables</strong> : Creates audit tables for any module that has audit enabled and where the audit table does not already exist. The results for each table are printed on the page.</li>
        <li><strong>Repair Database Tables</strong> : Checks to make sure the database is in synch with the table dictionary and vardef files. Any missing tables, columns, and indexes will be scripted to be recreated as well as any column properties that are incorrectly set in the database. The screen will display any database changes that should be made. Click "Execute" to execute the script to apply the changes to the Sugar database or click "Export" to save the script to a SQL file.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/f2968b99-7b45-23c0-3e6e-55028dadf59b.png" alt="" width="630" height="339" /></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="f0a0c07-1c8b-6620-8edc-551b22dd6372_Upgrade_Teams">Upgrade Teams</h2>
    <p>The Upgrade Teams option performs some cleanup regarding team records in Sugar. This can be useful to restore the private teams for all users in the event they become corrupted or are removed for any reason. The upgrade teams option performs the following actions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Global Team</strong> : Creates or restores the global team if it does not exist or has been deleted. All users are then assigned to the global team if not already.</li>
        <li><strong>Private Teams</strong> : Creates a private team for every user in the system that does not already have a private team and assigns the user to their private team.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The results are printed on the screen as to what teams already existed and what teams were created.</p>
    <h2 id="f0a0c07-1c8b-6620-8edc-551b22dd6372_Expand_Column_Width">Expand Column Width</h2>
    <p>The expand column width option provides a fix for some limitations of MSSQL when requiring multi-byte characters in the database. This limitation only exists for systems running on a MSSQL database while using the MSSQL Drivers for PHP. This function is not available and not necessary to be run on any of the currently supported database platforms.</p>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: We recommend running Sugar on at least version 2.0.1 of the SQLSRV Drivers.</p>
    <p>Use the following steps to run the Expand Column Width repair option:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select "Expand Column Width" from the Admin &gt; Repair screen.</li>
        <li>Select from the dropdown which of the following actions you would like to take: <br /><strong>Display SQL</strong> : Displays the appropriate sql commands on the screen. <br /><strong>Export SQL</strong> : Creates a .sql file containing the appropriate SQL commands. <br /><strong>Execute SQL</strong> : Executes the SQL commands on your database.</li>
        <li>Select "Go" to perform the selected action. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8f1cfe35-7e12-f7de-11b9-55028ddded8b.png" alt="" height="54" width="221" /></li>
        <li>The script takes any field in the database that is type varchar, char, or text and increases the length of the field. The new length is set to three times the current length, or if that is higher than 255, the length is set to 255.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="f0a0c07-1c8b-6620-8edc-551b22dd6372_Rebuild_htaccess_File">Rebuild .htaccess File</h2>
    <p>Rebuild .htaccess File option creates or updates the .htaccess file in the root of the Sugar directory. The .htaccess file contains specific commands to prevent unauthorized access to certain files and directories on your webserver. File permissions need to be configured correctly in order for Sugar to write to the .htaccess file. If writing to the file fails, the expected contents for the file will be printed on the page.</p>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: If you have additional lines to add to the .htaccess file, place them outside of the "# BEGIN SUGARCRM RESTRICTIONS" and "# END SUGARCRM RESTRICTIONS" lines or they will be removed when running this repair function.</p>
    <h2 id="f0a0c07-1c8b-6620-8edc-551b22dd6372_Rebuild_Config_File">Rebuild Config File</h2>
    <p>The Rebuild Config File option takes the config.php file in the root directory of Sugar and rebuilds it to have all default values for any options not specified directly. It first runs a check to make sure Sugar can write to the config.php file and will return to you if it can or not. When ready to rebuild the config file select "Rebuild". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/3292c67f-de12-0c0a-bb69-55028d1bdced.png" alt="" width="505" height="76" /><br /> The default values for the config will be merged with any custom values currently set and will be loaded into the config.php file.</p>
    <h2 id="f0a0c07-1c8b-6620-8edc-551b22dd6372_Rebuild_Sugar_Logic_Functions">Rebuild Sugar Logic Functions</h2>
    <p>The Rebuild Sugar Logic Functions rebuilds the cache files for all Sugar logic functions in the system. The Sugar logic functions are primarily used as formulas in field definitions. The results of the repair are shown on the screen.</p>
    <h2 id="f0a0c07-1c8b-6620-8edc-551b22dd6372_Rebuild_Relationships">Rebuild Relationships</h2>
    <p>Rebuild Relationships clears out the relationship cache and data and rebuilds it from the vardef files. Custom and stock relationships are all rebuilt. This repair option is good to run after an upgrade or when installing or uninstalling custom modules. The results of the repair are shown on the screen.</p>
    <h2 id="f0a0c07-1c8b-6620-8edc-551b22dd6372_Rebuild_Schedulers">Rebuild Schedulers</h2>
    <p>The Rebuild Schedulers option removes all schedulers and recreates schedulers that come with Sugar by default. If you have customized the Active/Inactive flag, the frequency the job runs, or even deleted a job this repair option will restore all settings back to their original default value and recreate any deleted default schedulers. <br /><br /><strong>Note</strong>: This also deletes any custom schedulers added to Sugar. If you have made changes to the default schedulers or created custom schedulers, please backup the details of each scheduler before running this repair. <br /> The schedulers and their default settings are listed below:<img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/64ed76d0-561b-95b1-e731-55028d9dc0ec.png" alt="" width="670" height="67" /></p>

    <h2 id="f0a0c07-1c8b-6620-8edc-551b22dd6372_Rebuild_Sugar_Dashlets">Rebuild Sugar Dashlets</h2>
    <p>Rebuild Sugar Dashlets deletes the cached dashlets.php file and recreates it. This file contains the path to the php files, the class to use, and the module for each dashlet in Sugar. This repair option is good to run when making changes to the dashlets that come with Sugar or custom dashlet loaded into Sugar. The results of the repair are shown on the screen.</p>
    <h2 id="f0a0c07-1c8b-6620-8edc-551b22dd6372_Rebuild_WorkFlow">Rebuild WorkFlow</h2>
    <p>Rebuild Workflow deletes files in the custom workflows folder for each module and then rebuilds the files from the workflow data in the database. This repair also verifies the proper logic hooks are in place to properly fire the workflows and rebuilds any plug-ins that are installed.</p>
    <h2 id="f0a0c07-1c8b-6620-8edc-551b22dd6372_Rebuild_Javascript_Languages">Rebuild Javascript Languages</h2>
    <p>The Rebuild Javascript Languages function deletes all files in the cached jsLanguage folder and deletes any {Module Name}.lang.php file in the cached modules folder. The cached files will be rebuilt when they are needed.</p>
    <h2 id="f0a0c07-1c8b-6620-8edc-551b22dd6372_Rebuild_JS_Compressed_Files">Rebuild JS Compressed Files</h2>
    <p>Rebuild JS Compressed Files takes every .js file located in the folder ./jssource/src_files/ and copies them to the root of your sugar directory. This will replace any compressed JavaScript files with the full readable versions. Any customizations made to the JavaScript files in the following folders and their subfolders will be lost:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>./install/</li>
        <li>./modules/</li>
        <li>./themes/</li>
        <li>./clients/</li>
        <li>./include/</li>
        <li>./service/</li>
        <li>./styleguide/</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: The process will continue working if you navigate away from this page, but if you wait you will see a notification on the page when it is complete.</p>
    <h2 id="f0a0c07-1c8b-6620-8edc-551b22dd6372_Rebuild_Sidecar_Files">Rebuild Sidecar Files</h2>
    <p>Rebuild Sidecar Files will replace compressed JavaScript files for the Sidecar framework with original, full JavaScript source files. The full files will then be compressed (minified) to maximize application performance.</p>
    <h2 id="f0a0c07-1c8b-6620-8edc-551b22dd6372_Rebuild_JS_Grouping_Files">Rebuild JS Grouping Files</h2>
    <p>Rebuild JS Grouping Files takes the many different JavaScript files that are required with Sugar and concatenates them together into the cache directory.</p>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: The process will continue working if you navigate away from this page, but if you wait you will see a notification on the page when it is complete.</p>
    <h2 id="f0a0c07-1c8b-6620-8edc-551b22dd6372_Rebuild_Minified_JS_Files">Rebuild Minified JS Files</h2>
    <p>Rebuild Minified JS Files takes every .js file located in the folder ./jssource/src_files/ and copies them to the root of your sugar directory. These files will then become compressed by removing new lines and unnecessary spaces. Compressing these files makes them harder to read for a person, but makes them smaller for transferring to web browsers.</p>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Not all files are compressed, but some are left in their original state.</p>
    <p>Any customizations made to the JavaScript files in the following folders and their subfolders will be lost:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>./install/</li>
        <li>./modules/</li>
        <li>./themes/</li>
        <li>./clients/</li>
        <li>./include/</li>
        <li>./service/</li>
        <li>./styleguide/</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This repair is essentially the same as performing a Rebuild JS Compressed Files followed by a Repair JS Files.</p>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: The process will continue working if you navigate away from this page, but if you wait you will see a notification on the page when it is complete.</p>
    <h2 id="f0a0c07-1c8b-6620-8edc-551b22dd6372_Rebuild_Sprites">Rebuild Sprites</h2>
    <p>Rebuild Sprites takes images in the following directories:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>./include/images</li>
        <li>./themes</li>
        <li>./custom/themes</li>

    <h2 id="f0a0c07-1c8b-6620-8edc-551b22dd6372_Repair_JS_Files">Repair JS Files</h2>
    <p>Repair JS Files takes the current JavaScript files and compresses them by removing new lines and unnecessary spaces. Compressing these files makes them harder to read for a person, but makes them smaller for transferring to web browsers.</p>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Not all files are compressed, but some are left in their original state. If you have customized the JavaScript files, then performing this repair will not remove your customizations where others can.</p>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: The process will continue working if you navigate away from this page, but if you wait you will see a notification on the page when it is complete.</p>
    <h2 id="f0a0c07-1c8b-6620-8edc-551b22dd6372_Repair_Non-Lowercase_Fields">Repair Non-Lowercase Fields</h2>
    <p>The Repair Non-Lowercase Fields option takes any custom field defined in Sugar and, if the field contains an upper case letter, it will change the field to be lowercase. The database, vardef files, and views are all searched through and corrected for and uppercase fields. This option also clears any vardef files from the cache when finished.</p>
    <h2 id="f0a0c07-1c8b-6620-8edc-551b22dd6372_Repair_Teams">Repair Teams</h2>
    <p>The Repair Teams option runs a quick check against the database for every user. It performs the following checks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Users not in the global team</li>
        <li>Users who do not have a private team</li>
        <li>Users who are not a member of a team that a user who reports to them is a member of</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If any of the checks return true, the page will indicate that records were found and the associated action will be selected by default. Select the options you wish to perform and click "Rebuild". <br /><br /> The selected options will perform the following:<img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/26942eb9-a69f-5be6-012e-550300c4f012.png" alt="" width="670" height="108" /></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rebuild access to global team</strong> : Create a global team if one does not exist and loops through every user and adds them to the global team.</li>
        <li><strong>Rebuild access to private team</strong> : Loops through every user and creates a private team if one does not exist, and then adds the user to their private team.</li>
        <li><strong>Rebuild team hierarchy</strong> : Loops through every user and makes sure every manager is included in their employees' teams. This ensures that if Sally reports to Jim, that Jim can see all of Sally's records. <br /><strong>Note</strong> : Sugar prevents a loop from being created via the Reports To field. For more information on setting the Reports To field, please refer to the <a href="#ec10f00-236f-9c84-9827-551b22807391_User_Fields">User Management</a> documentation.</li>
        <li><strong>Clean up unused combinations of teams</strong> : Searches the database for unused combinations of teams and deletes the records from the database.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The users looped through are displayed on the screen when complete.</p>
    <h2 id="f0a0c07-1c8b-6620-8edc-551b22dd6372_Repair_Roles">Repair Roles</h2>
    <p>Repair Roles goes through every ACL enabled module and ensures that there are appropriate database records to allow roles to be used on the specified module. This repair is important to run after adding new modules via Module Loader or Module Builder to make sure all of the role options are available for the new module. If there is a module that has ACL enabled for it, but the module does not show in the Roles section, then this repair option will add the module. The results of the modules accessed are printed on the screen.</p>
    <h2 id="f0a0c07-1c8b-6620-8edc-551b22dd6372_Repair_Inbound_Email_Accounts">Repair Inbound Email Accounts</h2>
    <p>Repair Inbound Email Accounts loops through every active inbound email account in Sugar and verifies the settings configured. Any Inbound email account that fails to successfully repair will be listed on the page and will require someone to manually repair them by reentering a valid user name and password.</p>
    <h2 id="f0a0c07-1c8b-6620-8edc-551b22dd6372_Remove_XSS">Remove XSS</h2>

<h2 id="f2906be-c8c9-5eea-7952-551b229a6790_Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Schedulers in Sugar provide users with a method to automate the execution of custom and system processes. Sugar comes with many default schedulers to perform jobs such as monitoring inbound emails, executing workflows, running reports, and dispatching campaign emails. Schedulers are available only to administrative users and can be accessed through Admin &gt; Schedulers. The following sections are available options from the Schedulers menu.</p>
<h2 id="f2906be-c8c9-5eea-7952-551b229a6790_Schedulers_Fields">Schedulers Fields</h2>
<p>The Schedulers module contains a number of stock fields which come out of the box with Sugar. The following definitions are suggested meanings for the fields, but the fields may be leveraged differently to best meet your organization's needs.</p>

<h3 id="f2906be-c8c9-5eea-7952-551b229a6790_Check_Inbound_Mailboxes">Check Inbound Mailboxes</h3>
<p>The Check Inbound Mailboxes scheduler is active and runs as often as possible by default. This scheduler will retrieve any unread email from active group inbound email accounts configured in the system. Personal and bounce mail accounts are not checked by this scheduler. If the group email account is configured to create cases or to send auto-reply emails, then this scheduler will handle those tasks as well. For more information on how to set up and configure a group inbound email account, please refer to the <a href="#fcd07b8-244f-f746-5e62-551b22f0e223_Creating_Group_Mail_Accounts">Email</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<h3 id="f2906be-c8c9-5eea-7952-551b229a6790_Clean_Jobs_Queue">Clean Jobs Queue</h3>
<p>The Clean Jobs Queue scheduler is active and runs every day at 5:00 AM by default. The jobs queue is essentially a log of when each scheduler has run. This scheduler will go through the job queues and either soft or hard delete old records in the jobs queue. A soft delete is simply hiding the record from Sugar, but keeping it in the database for recovery if necessary. A hard delete is permanently deleting it from the database. Job queue records will be soft and hard deleted by this scheduler with the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Soft Delete</strong> : Completed more than 7 days ago.</li>
    <li><strong>Hard Delete</strong> : Completed more than 21 days ago.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The number of days for a soft and hard delete are configurable through the sugar config files by modifying the values of <code>$sugar_config['jobs']['soft_lifetime']</code> and <code>$sugar_config['jobs']['hard_lifetime']</code>.</p>
<h3 id="f2906be-c8c9-5eea-7952-551b229a6790_Create_Future_TimePeriods">Create Future TimePeriods</h3>
<p>The Create Future TimePeriods scheduler is active and runs every day at 11:00 PM by default. When setting up the Forecasts module for the first time, you are prompted with what type of time period (Yearly or Quarterly) and how many future and past time periods you would like. This scheduler runs based off of those settings and creates new time period records as needed for forecast data entry.</p>
<p>For more information about configuring the time periods for forecasting, please refer to the <a href="#fbd0b77-0516-21e4-d5d3-551b223748cd_Forecast_Configuration">Forecast Configuration</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<h3 id="f2906be-c8c9-5eea-7952-551b229a6790_Process_Author_Scheduled_Job">Process Author Scheduled Job</h3>
<p>The Process Author Scheduled Job scheduler is responsible for processes associated with the Process Author business process management tool. It is active and runs as often as possible by default. The Process Author Scheduled Job will check for any active time-based process events in a pending state. If any processes meet this criterion, the scheduler will ensure the process flow continues. For more information about Process Author, please refer to the <a href="#e850d25-94e3-38db-da11-551b22b61fca_Process_Author">Process Author</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Process Author events processed by this scheduler will be run by the admin user (user id = '1') in Process History unless the admin user is disabled.</p>
<h3 id="f2906be-c8c9-5eea-7952-551b229a6790_Process_Workflow_Tasks">Process Workflow Tasks</h3>
<p>The Process Workflow Tasks scheduler is active and runs as often as possible by default. This scheduler processes and runs any time elapsed workflows are due to run. If you utilize time-elapsed workflows, it is highly recommended to run this scheduler as often as possible to ensure the workflows are executed quickly. For more information on creating workflows, please refer to the <a href="#fa00ab6-358f-6df2-baee-551b22857e08_Creating_Workflows">Workflow Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Workflows processed by this scheduler will be run by the admin user (user id = '1') unless the admin user is disabled.</p>
<h3 id="f2906be-c8c9-5eea-7952-551b229a6790_Prune_Database_on_1st_of_Month">Prune Database on 1st of Month</h3>
<p>The Prune Database on 1st of Month scheduler is inactive and runs at 4:00 AM on the first day of every month. Sugar implements a soft delete feature when deleting records through the application. Instead of deleting the record right away, the system marks a field called deleted in the database for the record. This scheduler runs through every table in the Sugar database and deletes any record that has this deleted flag. This is beneficial to keep the database small and efficient, but will remove the ability to recover accidentally deleted records. If you have a large database, we recommend activating this scheduler and running it once a month for performance.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Sugar keeps a backup of each record deleted by this scheduler in the form of a PHP file created in the cached backups folder. The file contains a SQL insert statement for each record in each table that was deleted to allow you to recover the data if necessary.</p>
<h3 id="f2906be-c8c9-5eea-7952-551b229a6790_Prune_Old_Record_Lists">Prune Old Record Lists</h3>
<p>The Prune Old Record Lists scheduler is active and runs as often as possible by default. This scheduler job will clean up backend database entries Sugar uses when generating export files. Such entries that are older than 1 hour from the current date and time will be removed from the <code>record_list</code> database table.</p>
<p>Keeping this scheduler active will help prevent exports from failing due to size limitations.</p>
<h3 id="f2906be-c8c9-5eea-7952-551b229a6790_Prune_Tracker_Tables">Prune Tracker Tables</h3>
<p>The Prune Tracker Tables scheduler is active and runs at 2:00 AM on the first day of every month by default. This scheduler will delete data in the tracker tables based on the tracker prune interval. This interval can be set from Admin &gt; Trackers and defaults to 30 days if not set. Any record older than the specified amount of days will be deleted from the following tables:</p>
<ul>
    <li>tracker</li>
    <li>tracker_sessions</li>
    <li>tracker_perf</li>
    <li>tracker_queries</li>
    <li>tracker_tracker_queries</li>
</ul>
<p>Keeping this scheduler active helps ensure overall system performance is kept at optimum levels, as these tables are continually updated via common actions in the application. For more information on trackers and setting this interval, please refer to the <a href="#efc04ca-ebba-0f36-db59-551b22839419_Tracker">Tracker</a> section in the System documentation of the Administration guide.</p>
<h3 id="f2906be-c8c9-5eea-7952-551b229a6790_Remove_Diagnostic_Tool_Files">Remove Diagnostic Tool Files</h3>
<p>The Remove Diagnostic Tool Files scheduler is active and runs Sundays at 4:00 AM by default. The <code>./cache/diagnostic</code> directory serves as a temporary directory for data generated by Sugar's Diagnostic Tool, which allows administrators and developers to capture basic system and server configuration details in order to diagnose problems in a Sugar instance. The tool places this data into a zip file on the server. The Remove Diagnostic Tool Files scheduler will remove any of these temporary files from the directory once a week during off-peak hours. For more information about the Diagnostic Tool, please refer to the <a href="#efc04ca-ebba-0f36-db59-551b22839419_Diagnostic_Tool">Diagnostic Tool</a> documentation.</p>
<h3 id="f2906be-c8c9-5eea-7952-551b229a6790_Remove_Temporary_Files">Remove Temporary Files</h3>
<p>The Remove Temporary Files scheduler is active and runs daily at 4:00 AM by default. Sugar uses a cache directory to store files such as images, documents, and installable modules uploaded by users. Some of these documents may be large in size and can cause performance issues. This scheduler will remove any unused files that are found in the <code>./uploads/tmp</code> directory or in most user-configured upload directories. For more information about temporary file storage, please refer to the <a href="#f32-564c-3795-551b221573bd_Changing_the_Upload_Directory">Advanced Configuration Options</a> documentation.</p>
<h3 id="f2906be-c8c9-5eea-7952-551b229a6790_Remove_Temporary_PDF_Files">Remove Temporary PDF Files</h3>
<p>The Remove Temporary PDF Files scheduler is active and runs daily at 4:00 AM by default. The <code>./cache/pdf/</code> directory serves as a temporary directory for in-progress PDF files generated from reports, quotes, and other parts of Sugar. Upon successful completion of the PDF operation, the file is typically removed from the directory, but there may be circumstances where orphaned PDF files could remain in the directory. This scheduler will remove any PDF files from the directory during off-peak hours.</p>
<h3 id="f2906be-c8c9-5eea-7952-551b229a6790_Run_Email_Reminder_Notifications">Run Email Reminder Notifications</h3>
<p>The Run Email Reminder Notifications scheduler is active and runs as often as possible by default. This scheduler will send out email reminders for meetings and calls that have met or passed the reminder time. Meetings and calls need to have a status that does not equal "Held" in order for the email reminder to be sent to invitees.</p>
<h3 id="f2906be-c8c9-5eea-7952-551b229a6790_Run_Nightly_Mass_Email_Campaigns">Run Nightly Mass Email Campaigns</h3>
<p>The Run Nightly Mass Email Campaigns scheduler is active and runs on the hour, every hour from 2:00 AM to 6:00 AM by default. This scheduler will process any campaign emails waiting to be sent in the email queue up to the configured batch amount. If the number of emails to send per batch is set to 500, and this scheduler is set to run once an hour, then you will be sending 500 emails per hour. Please configure this scheduler and the number of emails to send per batch to allow the proper amount of email to be sent.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Many email providers place limitations on email send rates such as emails per hour, emails per day, unique recipients, etc. Please check with your email provider to ensure that they will be able to process the volume of emails you desire to send through campaigns.</p>
<p>For more information on setting the number of emails sent per batch, please refer to the <a href="#fcd07b8-244f-f746-5e62-551b22f0e223_Campaign_Email_Settings">Campaign Email Settings</a> section in the Email documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<h3 id="f2906be-c8c9-5eea-7952-551b229a6790_Run_Nightly_Process_Bounced_Campaign_Emails">Run Nightly Process Bounced Campaign Emails</h3>
<p>The Run Nightly Process Bounced Campaign Emails scheduler is active and runs on the hour, every hour from 2:00 AM to 6:00 AM by default. This scheduler will retrieve any unread email from active bounce inbound mail accounts configured in the system. Bounce email accounts are important for receiving any bounced emails from a campaign. Emails in the bounce mail account must match all of the following criteria to be classified as a bounced email:</p>
<ul>
    <li>'From' email address must contain MAILER-DAEMON or POSTMASTER.</li>
    <li>'Remove me' link from the original email must be in the email body.</li>
    <li>The originating email does not have a campaign activity log type of invalid email or send error.</li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend setting this scheduler to run at the same time and interval as the Run Nightly Mass Email Campaigns scheduler. For more information on how to set up and configure a bounce inbound email account, please refer to the <a href="#fcd07b8-244f-f746-5e62-551b22f0e223_Creating_Bounce_Handling_Accounts">Email</a> documentation of the Administration guide.</p>
<h3 id="f2906be-c8c9-5eea-7952-551b229a6790_Run_Report_Generation_Scheduled_Tasks">Run Report Generation Scheduled Tasks</h3>
<p>The Run Report Generation Scheduled Tasks scheduler is inactive by default with an interval set to run daily at 6:00 AM when activated. This scheduler executes any scheduled reports and emails the results to the designated user. If you want to utilize scheduled reports, please enable this scheduler, otherwise the reports will not be emailed. We recommend running this scheduler as often as possible, this way if someone schedules a report for 6:15 AM, they will not have to wait until 7:00 to receive the report. For more information on scheduling reports, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/50_Reports#Scheduling_Reports">Scheduling Reports</a> section in the Reports documentation of the Application guide.</p>

<p>The Sugar Heartbeat scheduler is active with an interval set to run daily at 4:00 AM by default. This scheduler ensures that Sugar continues to receive heartbeat information even if no users have logged into your instance in the last three days. When this occurs, the Sugar heartbeat information will be sent automatically when cron runs.</p>
<h3 id="f2906be-c8c9-5eea-7952-551b229a6790_Update_tracker_sessions_Table">Update tracker_sessions Table</h3>
<p>The Update tracker_sessions Table scheduler is active and runs as often as possible by default. This scheduler updates the tracker_sessions table, setting all records that have a date older than six hours to not active. This ensures any user that is inactive for six hours or more will be logged out and their sessions will no longer be active. Please keep in mind that PHP settings on the server may be more restrictive than the six hour limitation on inactivity this scheduler imposes.</p>

<h2 id="f2906be-c8c9-5eea-7952-551b229a6790_Creating_Schedulers">Creating Schedulers</h2>
<p>There are various methods for creating schedulers in Sugar including via the Schedulers module and via duplication. The full edit view layout opens when creating the scheduler directly from the Schedulers menu and includes all of the relevant fields for your organization's schedulers. Schedulers can be created for built in jobs within the application or they can be created to call a URL outside of Sugar.</p>
<h3 id="f2906be-c8c9-5eea-7952-551b229a6790_Creating_via_Schedulers_Module">Creating via Schedulers Module</h3>
<p>One of the most common methods of scheduler creation is via the Create Scheduler option in the Schedulers module tab. This opens up the edit view layout which allows you to enter in all the relevant information for the scheduler.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to create a scheduler via the Schedulers module:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Hover on the Schedulers module and select "Create Scheduler". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/89bda161-72f4-c7bf-8f0b-550301bb88d7.png" alt="" width="252" height="157" /></li>
    <li>Enter appropriate values for the <a href="#f2906be-c8c9-5eea-7952-551b229a6790_Schedulers_Fields">fields</a> in the edit view layout.

</ol>
<h3 id="f2906be-c8c9-5eea-7952-551b229a6790_Creating_via_Duplication">Creating via Duplication</h3>
<p>You can also create a new scheduler by duplicating an existing scheduler record. The duplicate option is useful if the scheduler you are creating has similar information to an existing scheduler.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to create a scheduler by duplicating an existing record:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to a scheduler record's detail view.</li>
    <li>Select "Duplicate" from the Actions menu. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e7a39a36-9f60-27aa-f31b-550301750037.png" alt="" width="260" height="173" /></li>

<h2 id="f2906be-c8c9-5eea-7952-551b229a6790_Searching_Schedulers">Searching Schedulers</h2>
<p>The Schedulers list view includes a Basic Search to help you locate records easily and effectively in a module-specific manner. Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Schedulers list view below. Please note that Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %services). This will pull up any record that has the word "services" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p>
<p>For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/03_Search/#List_View_Search_%28Sidecar_Modules%29">Search</a> documentation.</p>

<h2 id="f2906be-c8c9-5eea-7952-551b229a6790_Deleting_Schedulers">Deleting Schedulers</h2>
<p>If a scheduler record is invalid and should no longer appear in your organization's Sugar instance, it may be deleted from either the Schedulers detail view or list view. Deleting via the detail view allows you to delete a single record while the list view allows for mass deleting multiple records at once.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> : If you wish to disable a scheduler, but do not want to delete it, you can set the status to Inactive and it will not be ran.</p>
<h3 id="f2906be-c8c9-5eea-7952-551b229a6790_Deleting_via_Detail_View">Deleting via Detail View</h3>
<p>Use the following steps to delete a scheduler record via the detail view:</p>
<ol>

<p>Due to PHP memory limitations on the server, there may be occasions when the application times out while deleting a large number of scheduler records. If you encounter an error when performing this action, we recommend selecting the records in smaller batches.</p>
<h2 id="f2906be-c8c9-5eea-7952-551b229a6790_Exporting_Schedulers">Exporting Schedulers</h2>
<p>Sugar's Export option allows users to download all fields for the selected schedulers to their computers as a .CSV (comma-separated values) file. This may be useful when needing to use Scheduler data with other software such as Microsoft Excel. Due to PHP memory limitations on the server, there may be occasions when the application times out while exporting a large number of scheduler records. If you encounter an error when performing this action, we recommend selecting the records in smaller batches.</p>
<p>Schedulers may be exported from the Schedulers list view by selecting "Export" from the Actions menu.</p>

<h2 id="f2906be-c8c9-5eea-7952-551b229a6790_Advanced_Options">Advanced Options</h2>
<p>From the edit view of a scheduler, you can select the Advanced Options checkbox to refine the interval of the scheduler as well as configure the Advanced Options panel. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/6b7ab4d4-15c3-f183-476d-550301d1be1d.png" alt="" width="450" height="311" /><br />This opens up the cron tab notation for the interval field. Cron tab notation gives administrators more flexibility to define when and how often the scheduler runs. Cron tab notation allows you to enter a value for each time part for the job to run on. You can specify complex values by using the following notations:</p>
<table cellpadding="4" border="1" cellspacing="0">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Character</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span>*</span></td>
            <td>Asterisk is used to represent every value for the specified time part. For example, <code>*</code> in the mins field will run every minute.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span>/</span></td>
            <td>Forward slash is used to represent increments. For example, <code>*/15</code> in the mins field will run every 15 minutes. <code>30/5</code> in the mins field will run starting at the 30th minute of the hour and every 5 minutes after.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span>,</span></td>
            <td>Comma is used to specify multiple values. For example, <code>18,20</code> in the hrs field will run at 6:00 PM and 8:00 PM.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span> - </span></td>
            <td>Hyphen is used to specify a range of values. For example, <code>1-6</code> in the mo field will run from January through June.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>Specify the values to run in the following interval fields using cron tab notation:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>min</strong> : Specify the minute of the hour to run on (0-59).</li>
    <li><strong>hrs</strong> : Specify the hour of the day to run on (0-23).</li>
    <li><strong>date</strong> : Specify the day of the month to run on (1-31).</li>

<p>You may specify any combination of the fields to create the schedule needed to run the job.</p>
<h2 id="f2906be-c8c9-5eea-7952-551b229a6790_Setting_up_Cron_Scheduler">Setting up Cron Scheduler</h2>
<p>In order for the schedulers to run at the designated times, there needs to be a process running on the server to initiate the schedulers. This backend process will call the cron.php file in Sugar with some specific parameters, and the cron.php file will execute the schedulers as necessary.</p>
<p>Sugar instances hosted on-demand by SugarCRM have the cron scheduler set up automatically, but it must be configured for on-site instances. In UNIX systems (MAC and Linux) you can configure crontab to run the schedulers. Navigate to Admin &gt; Scheduler to get the system information necessary to set up the crontab.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The scheduler is throttled by default to prevent it from being ran more often than every 30 seconds. This value is configurable by setting the <code>$sugar_config['cron']['min_cron_interval']</code> value in the config_override.php file.<img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/44d41e0e-905e-8413-36b8-550301d44ed0.png" alt="" width="505" height="69" /></p>
<h3 id="f2906be-c8c9-5eea-7952-551b229a6790_Setting_Up_in_UnixLinux">Setting Up in Unix/Linux</h3>
<p>Use the following steps to set up crontab to run the Sugar schedulers:</p>
<ol>
    <li>From a command prompt, execute the following command: <code>crontab -u apache -e</code></li>
    <li>The text editor will launch as the user "apache". If your webserver is running under a different user, please adjust the line accordingly.</li>
    <li>Add in the commands from Admin &gt; Schedulers into the crontab file: <br /><code>* * * * * cd /var/www/sugar123; php -f cron.php &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1<br /></code><strong>Note</strong>: Make sure that the path to the root directory of Sugar and to PHP is correct.</li>
    <li>Save the changes to the file. This will run the cron job every minute.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can check crontab to see what commands are being run by executing the following command: "crontab -u apache -l".</p>

    <p>You can also create a new template by duplicating an existing template record. The duplicate option is useful if the template you are creating has a similar layout to an existing template.</p>
    <p>Use the following steps to create a template by duplicating an existing record:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Navigate to a template record's detail view.</li>
        <li>Select "Duplicate" from the Actions menu. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/6e460462-f4b2-ab4a-6f81-550301f909d1.png" alt="" width="208" height="182" /></li>
        <li>The displayed edit view is pre-populated with the original template's values. Update the necessary <a href="#f1a0bbb-6f3c-1b9f-456e-551b22e38c4f_PDF_Manager_Fields">fields</a>, then click "Save". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/4f0f6822-9a22-cc27-6df8-55030122728c.png" alt="" width="254" height="216" /></li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: If you change the module field during duplication, you will have to remove all variable references to the old module in the layout before saving.</p>
    <h3 id="f1a0bbb-6f3c-1b9f-456e-551b22e38c4f_Creating_Content">Creating Content</h3>
    <p>The PDF template can contain images and HTML formatting as well as variable fields from the assigned module. TincyMCE is the rich text editor for formatting your template using HTML. For more information on using TinyMCE, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/02_User_Interface#TinyMCE">TinyMCE</a> section in the User Interface in the Application guide.</p>
    <p>To add variable fields from the assigned module, simply select the desired field from the Field dropdown and then click "Insert".<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/bb433ef2-5ab3-e5fe-ef6d-55030159af1c.png" alt="" width="436" height="69" /></p>
    <p>The variable will be placed wherever your computer's cursor is located in the template and can be moved around as necessary.</p>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: The Link section provides all one-to-one and one-to-many relationships to provide linked data in the template.</p>
    <p>For modules that have a subset of data in the template (e.g. Product line items in Quotes), there are special containers in the template that indicate where the repeating areas start and stop. These containers are designated by the following commands :</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Start</strong> : {foreach from=$product_bundles item="bundle"}</li>
        <li><strong>End</strong> : {/foreach}</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="f1a0bbb-6f3c-1b9f-456e-551b22e38c4f_Searching_PDF_Templates">Searching PDF Templates</h2>
    <p>The PDF Manager list view includes a Basic Search to help you locate records easily and effectively in a module-specific manner. Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the PDF Manager list view below. Please note that Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %services). This will pull up any record that has the word "services" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p>
    <p>For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/03_Search#List_View_Search_%28Sidecar_Modules%29">Search</a> documentation.</p>
    <p>Basic search offers a few, commonly used fields for a simplified search experience. <br />The buttons and checkboxes available in Basic Search panel have the following functions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Search</strong> : Click the Search button or press your Return/Enter key to perform the search.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear</strong> : Click the Clear button to clear all criteria from the searchable fields.</li>
    </ul>

For example, if you select a module and enter a template name, Sugar will only return template records with a matching name that are assigned to that module. Once the search is complete, the relevant results will populate in the <a href="#f1a0bbb-6f3c-1b9f-456e-551b22e38c4f_PDF_Manager_List_View">list view</a> below the search panel. To see all template records, simply click "Clear" and then "Search" to perform a blank search with no filters.</p>

<h2 id="f380e03-eb33-98b7-0e3f-551b2269b7f9_Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Web logic hooks allow you to establish events on a per module basis for Sugar to send data from the record in focus to an external URL so that additional processing can be completed outside the Sugar application. When a Web Logic Hook is triggered, the data is not sent instantaneously. Rather, the data is queued and processed under the Dispatch Web Logic Hook scheduled job. Once the job is processed through a regular scheduler run, the data for the record that triggered the hook is transmitted to the designated URL in a JSON format for further processing.This can allow you to send this data to other applications within your organization or to manipulate the data and transmit it back to Sugar via the REST API.</p>
<h2 id="f380e03-eb33-98b7-0e3f-551b2269b7f9_Web_Logic_Hook_Fields">Web Logic Hook Fields</h2>
<p>The Web Logic Hooks module contains a number of stock fields which come out-of-the-box with Sugar. The below definitions are suggested meanings for the fields, but the fields can be leveraged differently to best meet your organization's needs.</p>

<h2 id="f380e03-eb33-98b7-0e3f-551b2269b7f9_Creating_Web_Logic_Hooks">Creating Web Logic Hooks</h2>
<p>There are two methods for creating web logic hooks in Sugar including via the Web Logic Hooks module and duplication.</p>
<h3 id="f380e03-eb33-98b7-0e3f-551b2269b7f9_Creating_Via_Web_Logic_Hooks_Module">Creating Via Web Logic Hooks Module</h3>
<p>The most common methods of web logic hook creation is via the Web Logic Hooks module using the Create Web Logic Hook option in the module tab or the Create button on the list view. This opens the record view layout which allows you to enter all of the relevant information for the account.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to create a web logic hook via the Web Logic Hooks module:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click the triangle in the Web Logic Hooks module tab to open the actions menu and select "Create Web Logic Hook". You can also click the Create button on the upper right of the Web Logic Hooks list view. <br />From Web Logic Hooks module tab: <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/c28f48ab-abcd-0006-1273-550301abd6f4.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/c28f48ab-abcd-0006-1273-550301abd6f4.png" height="87" width="288" /><br />From Web Logic Hooks list view: <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/502c3cdd-b8c0-ac97-6433-5503011da94e.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/502c3cdd-b8c0-ac97-6433-5503011da94e.png" width="462" height="106" /></li>
    <li>Enter appropriate values for the <a href="#f380e03-eb33-98b7-0e3f-551b2269b7f9_Web_Logic_Hook_Fields">fields</a> in the record view layout. All required fields will indicate "Required" in the field and must be completed prior to saving.</li>
    <li>Once the necessary information is entered, click "Save".
        <ul>
            <li>Alternatively, you can use the Actions Menu to the right of the Save button to select "Save and view" or "Save and create new". "Save and view" will display the record's details after the save is complete. "Save and create new" saves the current record and opens a new, blank record view in edit mode where you can create another record.</li>
        </ul><br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a91f74c6-b1fe-0e82-5f02-550301f0a811.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a91f74c6-b1fe-0e82-5f02-550301f0a811.png" width="500" height="101" /></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="f380e03-eb33-98b7-0e3f-551b2269b7f9_Creating_Via_Duplication">Creating Via Duplication</h3>
<p>You can also create a new web logic hook by duplicating an existing web logic hook record. The Copy option is useful if the web logic hook you are creating has similar information to an existing web logic hook.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to create a web logic hook by duplicating an existing record:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to an web logic hook's record view.</li>
    <li>Click the Actions menu and select "Copy". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/4bb5027d-fe22-9193-05c0-550301443535.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/4bb5027d-fe22-9193-05c0-550301443535.png" width="500" height="99" /></li>
    <li>The displayed record view is pre-populated with the original account's values. Update the necessary fields, then click "Save".
        <ul>
            <li>Alternatively, you can use the Actions Menu to the right of the Save button to select "Save and view" or "Save and create new". "Save and view" will display the record's details after the save is complete. "Save and create new" saves the current record and opens a new, blank record view in edit mode where you can create another record.</li>
        </ul><br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a91f74c6-b1fe-0e82-5f02-550301f0a811.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a91f74c6-b1fe-0e82-5f02-550301f0a811.png" width="500" height="101" /></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="f380e03-eb33-98b7-0e3f-551b2269b7f9_Viewing_Web_Logic_Hooks">Viewing Web Logic Hooks</h2>
<p>There are various options available for viewing web logic hook records in Sugar including via Web Logic Hooks list view, Web Logic Hooks record view, and Web Logic Hooks Recently Viewed menu.</p>
<h3 id="f380e03-eb33-98b7-0e3f-551b2269b7f9_Viewing_Via_List_View">Viewing Via List View</h3>

<h2 id="f380e03-eb33-98b7-0e3f-551b2269b7f9_Searching_Web_Logic_Hooks">Searching Web Logic Hooks</h2>
<p>The Web Logic Hooks list view includes a module search to help you locate records easily and effectively in a module-specific manner. Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Web Logic Hooks list view below. Please note that Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %services). This will pull up any record that has the word "services" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p>
<p>For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/03_Search#List_View_Search_%28Sidecar_Modules%29">Search</a> documentation.</p>
<h3 id="f380e03-eb33-98b7-0e3f-551b2269b7f9_Module_Search">Module Search</h3>
<p>Module search enables users to easily search by account name within the Accounts module and pull up matching records in the list view. The search also provides a Filter option allowing you to narrow your search further using the available options as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>All Web Logic Hooks</strong> : Returns all records in the module</li>
    <li><strong>My Favorites</strong> : Returns only records you have marked as favorites</li>
    <li><strong>Recently Viewed </strong>: Returns only records you have viewed in the module within the last 7 days</li>
    <li><strong>Recently Created </strong>: Returns only records you created in the module within the last 7 days</li>
    <li><strong>Create Filter </strong>: Create a new custom filter which you can use to filter your search</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/3f0022a5-703b-2f8b-2f50-5503012dfc01.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/3f0022a5-703b-2f8b-2f50-5503012dfc01.png" width="242" height="250" /></p>
<p>When you choose a filter and run a search, Sugar will return accounts with a matching name from within the filtered list view results. For example, if you select "My Favorites" in the Filter options and enter an account name, Sugar will only return account records with a matching name that are favorited by you. Once the search is complete, the relevant results will populate in the <a href="#f380e03-eb33-98b7-0e3f-551b2269b7f9_Web_Logic_Hooks_List_View">list view</a> below the search bar. To see all account records to which you have access, simply select the All Web Logic Hooks option in the filter and remove any text from the search bar.</p>
<h3 id="f380e03-eb33-98b7-0e3f-551b2269b7f9_Creating_a_Filter">Creating a Filter</h3>
<p>Users can also create new filters via the Create Filter option in the Filter list of the search bar. This allows users to add custom, complex filter options when searching in the Web Logic Hooks list view. You have the option to add multiple fields to your new filter by clicking the Plus button to the right of the filter selection dropdown lists. Please note that each one of the filter's criteria need to be true for a record in order for it to appear in the list view search result.</p>
<p>The following steps cover creating a new search by Name filter as an example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click the Filter option on the Web Logic Hooks search bar then select "Create Filter". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/3a5e95ba-ac09-455d-7c9b-550301059c91.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/3a5e95ba-ac09-455d-7c9b-550301059c91.png" width="195" height="243" /></li>
    <li>
        <p>Select the field you wish to add to your filter as well as the condition and matching criteria.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>To add multiple fields to the new filter, click the Plus button to the right of the filter dropdown list.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>To remove fields from the new filter, click the Minus button to the right of the filter dropdown list. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/dda238d5-79f7-8258-1708-550301272fd6.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/dda238d5-79f7-8258-1708-550301272fd6.png" width="500" height="227" /></p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>The list view will automatically display results matching your filters as you create and modify the criteria.</p>
<h3 id="f380e03-eb33-98b7-0e3f-551b2269b7f9_Saving_a_Filter">Saving a Filter</h3>
<p>Once a user has created a new filter, they have the option of saving it. Doing so will preserve the chosen fields as well as the conditions and values. The saved filter will then be available from the Filter dropdown menu in the module search bar to allow for easy retrieval of important sets of filters and values.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to save a new filter:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Create a <a href="#f380e03-eb33-98b7-0e3f-551b2269b7f9_Creating_a_Filter">new filter</a> to perform a search on your desired fields.</li>
    <li>Enter in a name for the new filter (e.g. "Contact Hooks"). <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/56dfd7d3-f9fe-0fb4-e03d-550301396d33.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/56dfd7d3-f9fe-0fb4-e03d-550301396d33.png" width="500" height="250" /></li>

<p>Between multiple users working in Sugar, importing new records, and converting leads, it is possible for duplicate web logic hook records to be accidentally input to the system. Before creating a new web logic hook record, a good practice is to first check that the web logic hook does not already exist in Sugar. You can locate duplicate records for cleanup using <a href="#f380e03-eb33-98b7-0e3f-551b2269b7f9_Module_Search">module search</a> from the Web Logic Hooks list view. Searching for web logic hooks with similar names or other information can turn search into a powerful, duplicates-finding tool. Sugar also provides a wizard for finding potential duplicates that is available from the Web Logic Hooks record view and may be used as shown below. If duplicate web logic hook records are detected, you can perform a merge per the <a href="#f380e03-eb33-98b7-0e3f-551b2269b7f9_Merging_Web_Logic_Hooks">Merging Web Logic Hooks</a> section of this documentation.</p>
<p>Please note that your ability to use the Find Duplicates action may be restricted by any role which prevents web logic hook deletion. For more information on roles, please refer to the <a href="#fdc0792-a630-699f-112c-551b22b26707_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide. Check with your system administrator if you do not see the Find Duplicates option.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to locate duplicate web logic hooks using the Find Duplicates option from the Web Logic Hooks record view:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to an web logic hook's record view.</li>
    <li>Choose "Find Duplicates" from the Actions menu. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/be0fa54d-df11-675e-b939-55030183edb8.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/be0fa54d-df11-675e-b939-55030183edb8.png" width="400" height="204" /></li>
    <li>Potential duplicate web logic hook records will be listed on the Find Duplicates page. Select the duplicate record(s) you wish to merge then click "Merge Duplicates".
        <ul>
            <li>You can preview the duplicate record's details by clicking the Preview button to the far right of the records row.</li>
            <li>You can search for specific records from the Web Logic Hooks list view if you wish to check for more possible duplicates. For more information on performing a search, please refer to the <a href="#f380e03-eb33-98b7-0e3f-551b2269b7f9_Module_Search">Module Search</a> section of this documentation.</li>
            <li>You can also click the Column Selection icon above the Preview button to change the list of fields that display on the list view column headers.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Once you click "Merge Duplicates", the merging process with the current record will begin. For instructions on performing the merge that follows, please refer to Steps 3-9 of the <a href="#f380e03-eb33-98b7-0e3f-551b2269b7f9_Merging_Via_List_View">Merging Via List View</a> section of this documentation.</p>

<p>When duplicate records are identified in Sugar, you have the option to merge two or more web logic hooks into a single record. Once the merge is complete, the duplicate web logic hook record(s) will be deleted, and the primary record will remain. Please note that all relationships belonging to the duplicate web logic hooks will be merged to the primary record meaning that any calls, meetings, cases, etc. related to the duplicate web logic hook record(s) will automatically be related to the resulting, merged web logic hook record.</p>

Make any necessary changes in the sections below and click "Save" to commit the changes. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/964628f5-1ab4-350f-fbd5-550300808cc8.png" alt="" width="129" height="73" /></p>
    <h3 id="fcd07b8-244f-f746-5e62-551b22f0e223_Outgoing_Mail_Configuration">Outgoing Mail Configuration</h3>
    <p>The Outgoing Mail Configuration section contains details for sending email notifications, scheduled reports, workflow alerts, etc. Enter appropriate values for the following fields keeping in mind all required fields are marked with a red asterisk and must be completed prior to saving:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>From Name</strong> : The name outgoing email will come from; for example, the name of your organization. Defaults to "SugarCRM".</li>
        <li><strong>From Address</strong> : The email address outgoing email will come from. Defaults to "<span>do_not_reply@example.com". <br /><strong>Note</strong> : If specifying a different address than the email address associated with the account you are authenticating, the email server being utilized may need to be configured to allow the email account to send email as the entered From Address.</span></li>
        <li><strong>Choose Your Email Provider</strong> : Choose your mail provider to populate provider specific values.</li>
        <li><strong>SMTP Server</strong> : The web address of the external email server Sugar will connect to.</li>
        <li><strong>SMTP Port</strong> : The communication port number used for connecting to the mail server.</li>
        <li><strong>Use SMTP Authentication?</strong> : Check this box to connect to the SMTP server using a user name and password. If left unchecked, the SMTP server must accept anonymous connections, which is not recommended.</li>
        <li><strong>Enable SMTP over SSL or TLS?</strong> : Select the appropriate option from the dropdown to use Secure Socket Layer, Transport Layer Security, or no encryption when connecting to the mail server.</li>
        <li><strong>Email Address / Username</strong> : Enter the email address or user name to connect to the SMTP server with.</li>
        <li><strong>Password</strong> : Enter the password associated with the entered email address or user name.</li>
        <li><strong>Allow users to use this account for outgoing email</strong> : Check this box if you would like users to be able to send emails using the same outbound mail account. If the option is not selected, users will still be able to use the outbound mail server to send emails by entering their personal mail account information in their user preferences. For more information on setting up the email settings in user preferences, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/01_Getting_Started#Email_Settings">Email Settings</a> section of the Getting Started documentation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once the appropriate mail server information is entered, you can send a test email to make sure it is configured properly. Click "Send Test Email", enter your email address, and send the test. If you do not receive the test email, re-enter the account information including the password to ensure it is all correct. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/6fad2c2e-0037-a2e4-06c2-55030095922c.png" alt="" width="670" height="444" /></p>

    <p>The Email Options section provides some global options for email configuration. Check the box next to the desired options:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Assignment Notifications</strong> : Sends email notifications to users automatically when records are assigned to them. When assigning a record to yourself, you will not receive a notification of the assignment. Default is checked. <br /><strong>Note</strong> : To receive notifications, users must also have "Notify on Assignment" checked in their user profile.</li>
        <li><strong>Delete related notes &amp; attachments with deleted Emails</strong> : Related notes and attachments are deleted when an email is deleted. This ensures that data is not orphaned in the system when an email is deleted. Default is checked.</li>
        <li><strong>Send notification from assigning user's e-mail address</strong> : Sends notifications from the email address and name of the user who is assigning a record to another user. Default is not checked. <br /><strong>Note</strong> : The SMTP server being used must allow sending from a different email address than the authenticated account and the email account may need to be configured to allow the Send As permission.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="fcd07b8-244f-f746-5e62-551b22f0e223_Email_Security_Settings">Email Security Settings</h3>
    <p>The Email Security Settings section allows Sugar administrators to decide which HTML tags are allowed to be displayed in Sugar. The selected tags will not be allowed for viewing within Sugar. There are two options to mass set the tag selection:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Select Outlook default minimum security settings</strong> : Select this option to automatically select every tag that Outlook also restricts. This will not strip the style tag which is used by default in Outlook. This option is selected by default.</li>
        <li><strong>Toggle All Options</strong> : Select this option to either select all tags, or deselect all tags.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After selecting one of those options you can individually select or deselect additional tags to restrict or allow the tags respectively. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/587f6cb0-8459-a423-ce61-550300058fa6.png" alt="" width="574" height="242" /></p>
    <h2 id="fcd07b8-244f-f746-5e62-551b22f0e223_Related_Contacts_Emails">Related Contacts Emails</h2>
    <p>The Related Contacts Emails section allows administrators to enable or disable related contact's emails from appearing in the Emails subpanel and History dashlet for certain modules (Cases, Accounts, Opportunities). In order to have emails from related contacts appear in the Emails subpanel, simply mark the checkbox to the right of the module name (e.g. Opportunities). To disable related contact's emails from appearing in the Emails subpanel, uncheck the box for the specific module as necessary. Click "Save" to preserve the change.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/1e284322-3d52-8414-f36f-55030094d5e3.png" alt="" width="666" height="106" /></p>
    <h2 id="fcd07b8-244f-f746-5e62-551b22f0e223_Campaign_Email_Settings">Campaign Email Settings</h2>
    <p>The Campaign Email Settings section allows Sugar administrators to configure some backend settings for sending campaign emails. Select the appropriate values for the following fields keeping in mind all required fields are marked with a red asterisk and must be completed prior to saving:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Number of emails sent per batch</strong> : When the "Run Nightly Mass Email Campaigns" scheduler runs, it will send out the specified number of emails for a single run. The default is set to 500. Some mail servers have one or more of the following restrictions for a specific timeframe (e.g. hour, day, etc.): the number of unique recipients, how many times the same email can be sent to individual recipients, and the most common, how many emails can be delivered. This setting helps control the outgoing email to conform to these restrictions. For example, if your scheduler is set to run every hour, the number of emails to send per batch is set to 500, and you have 1600 emails to send out, starting at 2:00 AM the last batch of emails will be sent at 5:00 AM. Please check with your email provider to determine the proper level.</li>
        <li><strong>Location of campaign tracking files</strong> : Campaign tracking files log responses from campaign targets. If you are running Sugar on an external network, select "Default" to accept the default location. However, if your Sugar instance is behind a firewall, then choose "User Defined" and specify the path to your external web server in the field below. The external web server must have the ability to connect to your Sugar instance behind the firewall. Ensure that you create a file named index.php to handle requests for three different types of entry points: campaign_trackerv2, removeme, and image, and place the index.php file in the path to your external web server. This index.php file must make the appropriate calls to the index.php file located in the root of your Sugar instance in order to properly record the activities in Sugar. For more information on how to setup a custom campaign tracker page, please refer to the <a href="#f32-564c-3795-551b221573bd_Using_a_Custom_Page_For_Campaign_Trackers">Using a Custom Page For Campaign Trackers</a> section of the Advanced Config Options documentation in the Administration guide.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep copies of campaign messages</strong> : Set this option to "Yes" to keep a copy of every email sent during a campaign. If "No" is selected, the template is stored, but not the individual emails sent. Default is set to "No". <br /><strong>Note</strong> : Storing every email sent does take up space in the database and can reduce performance. We recommend setting this value to "No".</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="fcd07b8-244f-f746-5e62-551b22f0e223_Email_Archiving">Email Archiving</h2>
    <p>Sugar Email Archiving allows users to easily archive email to Sugar records simply by sending the email to a special email address. The email archiving service monitors the email address and imports the email into your instance of sugar and links related records without the use of a plug-in or other synching process. This service is only available for Sugar Professional subscriptions and above.</p>

            <h3 id="fcd07b8-244f-f746-5e62-551b22f0e223_Enabling_Email_Archiving">Enabling Email Archiving</h3>
            <p>Before you can use Sugar Email Archiving, you need to enable the service for your instance. Email Archiving can only be activated for one instance per license key. If you have a test instance with Email Archiving activated, that service will need to be deactivated before your production instance can be activated. <br />Use the following steps to enable email archiving via the administration page:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>In the Email section of the administration page, Select "Email Archiving". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e9c40a03-0c36-a7b2-baf9-5503001166f2.png" alt="" width="420" height="149" /></li>
                <li>Read the Email Archiving feature description, Master Subscription Agreement, and privacy policy.</li>
                <li>Select the checkbox to agree to the teams and click "Enable Email Archiving". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/24d45019-57b6-7965-348a-5503007536fe.png" alt="" width="450" height="37" /><br /><strong>Note</strong> : Your instance needs to be reachable over the internet from SugarCRM's Email Archiving server. Specifically, the URL http(s)://{site_url}/service/v4/rest.php needs to be accessible from our On-Demand IP range, 70.42.242.0/24 (this is the same as 70.42.242.0 with a 255.255.255.0 subnet mask). This site_url value is specified in your config.php and must match the publicly accessible URL.</li>
                <li>The next screen displays a status of Enabled and your instance's unique email address for Email Archiving.</li>
                <li>Click "Disable Email Archiving" to turn off this feature. <br /><strong>Note</strong> : If you disable and re-enable Email Archiving you will receive a different unique email address.</li>

    <h3 id="fcd07b8-244f-f746-5e62-551b22f0e223_Using_Email_Archiving">Using Email Archiving</h3>
    <p>To automatically archive an email into Sugar using the Email Archiving service, simply include your system's unique email address in the To, Cc, or Bcc fields when composing, replying, or forwarding an email. The email will then be archived into your Sugar database including any attachments on the email. <br />Sugar will automatically create relationships to the imported email for any stock module records that match an email address in the From, To, and Cc fields in the email. In addition, the Sugar Email Archiving service will also scan the body of the email to archive the email to records with a matching email address. Please note that in order for the email address to be recognized properly for email archiving, it must be displayed as "To: (End Client Name (optional)) " (e.g. To: John Smith john@example.com&gt;) in the body of the email. The archived email will appear in the History dashlet for any matching records in Sugar. <br /><strong>Note</strong>: The Bcc field can not be seen by the Sugar email archive service just like they are not visible to any other recipient of the email.. Any email addresses included in the Bcc will not get relationships made to them from the email. <br />The following are some features and limitations for the email archiving service:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Meetings</strong> : If the email archived contains a calendar event, Sugar will archive the email as well as create a Meeting record. The meeting created will also be related to the matching records in Sugar via the email addresses in the From, To, and Cc fields.</li>
        <li><strong>Cases</strong> : Email containing the case macro in the email's Subject field will also be archived to a Case record. By default, the case macro is [CASE:{number}], meaning that an email with subject "[Case:1024] Help needed!" will be automatically archived to case number 1024. For more information on how to change the case macro, please refer to the <a href="#fcd07b8-244f-f746-5e62-551b22f0e223_Modifying_the_Case_Macro">Modifying the Case Macro</a> section.</li>
        <li><strong>Custom Modules</strong> : Currently, Sugar Email Archiving is only able to match email addresses on stock modules. Any relationships between the archived email and custom modules will have to be made manually.</li>
        <li><strong>Size Limit</strong> : Sugar Email Archiving can process emails up to 10 MB in size including attachments.</li>
        <li><strong>Implicit Relationships</strong> : Sugar Email Archiving creates an implicit relationship between the email and matching records via the email addresses on the email. This implicit relationship behaves and sometimes displays differently than an explicit relationship. For example, an email implicitly related to Beth Roberts' Contact record would appear in her History subpanel just like one that is explicitly related. However, if Beth's email address is updated in Sugar, the emails created via Sugar Email Archiving will no longer appear in her History since the email addresses no longer match. You can explicitly relate a contact to an email by selecting the contact in the email's Contacts subpanel.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="fcd07b8-244f-f746-5e62-551b22f0e223_Inbound_Email">Inbound Email</h2>
    <p>Inbound Email allows external email to be pulled into Sugar and can be accessed from the admin page under the Email section. Inbound accounts can be configured as personal, group, or bounce mail accounts. There are various ways you can create inbound accounts in Sugar such as via the Inbound Email module tab and the Emails module. Once the inbound account record is created, you can view and edit information via the Inbound Email detail view. Some inbound accounts can be configured to create Case records in Sugar or send automatic replies to imported email. This section will cover how to use the Inbound Email module as well as the various actions and options available from within the module.</p>

    <p>There are various methods for creating inbound email accounts in Sugar including via Inbound Email module, Emails module, Campaigns module and duplication. The full edit view layout opens when creating the inbound account directly from the Inbound Email menu and includes all of the relevant fields for your organization's accounts.</p>
    <p>For more information on how to create a personal inbound email account, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/23_Emails#Settings">Emails</a> documentation in the application guide. <br />For more information on how to create a bounce handling inbound email account via the Campaigns module, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/32_Campaigns#Set_Up_Email">Campaigns</a> documentation in the application guide.</p>
    <p>From the Inbound Email module tab you can create two kinds of Inbound Email Accounts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Group Mail Accounts</strong> : Allows multiple users, such as team members, to view emails from an external mail account. When you receive emails that are addressed to your organization but not to any particular user, you can route it to a Group mail account such as <span>support@example.com</span> or <span>sales@example.com</span>. Users can subsequently distribute emails in the Group mail account to other team members.<strong><strong><br /></strong></strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Note</strong>: Group Mail Accounts will only import unread messages from the mail server.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Bounce Handling Mail Accounts</strong> : Stores campaign emails that bounce back to you due to incorrect email addresses. You can create a bounce handling inbox separately for each campaign, or you can create one that is common to all campaigns. The system tags every bounced campaign email with a unique identifier that enables you to identify the campaign.</li>
    </ul>

This opens up the edit view layout which allows you to enter in all the relevant information for the group mail account. Please note that Group Mail Accounts will only import unread messages from the mail server.</p>
    <p>Use the following steps to create a group mail account via the Inbound Email module:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Navigate to Admin &gt; Inbound Email.</li>

    <p>The Case Macro field determines what distinct string Sugar will use to match emails to the Cases module. The Case Macro is on the Inbound Email list view and displays the current case macro string. By default this string is set to [CASE:%1]. To customize it, you can change CASE to a different word, but you must preserve the rest of the string; for example, [TICKET NUMBER:%1]. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d51b0f9e-8040-c207-e155-5503006aa55f.png" alt="" width="670" height="133" /><br />Click "Save" to preserve your changes.</p>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Incoming emails must have no space before the case number in order to be related to the existing case. For example, an email with the subject "[Case:1234]" will automatically be related to case number 1234 while an email with the subject "[Case: 1234]" will not.</p>
    <h4 id="fcd07b8-244f-f746-5e62-551b22f0e223_Pagination">Pagination</h4>
    <p>List view displays the current results broken into pages that you can scroll through rather than displaying potentially thousands of rows at once. To the right just below the case macro you can see which records of the total results set are currently being displayed. The two single-arrow Next and Previous buttons can be used to scroll through the records page-by-page. The two double-arrow First Page and Last Page buttons allow you to skip to the beginning or the end of your current results. <br />By default, Sugar displays 20 records per list view page, but administrators can change the number of records displayed via Admin &gt; System Settings.

Deleting inbound account records will not delete the email imported from this account.</p>
    <h4 id="fcd07b8-244f-f746-5e62-551b22f0e223_Deleting_Via_Detail_View">Deleting Via Detail View</h4>
    <p>Use the following steps to delete an inbound account record via the detail view:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Navigate to an inbound account record's detail view.</li>
        <li>Select "Delete". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b25aeb1d-cf9d-859c-f044-550301c44c3a.png" alt="" width="285" height="162" /></li>
        <li>A pop-up message will display asking for confirmation. Click "Ok" to proceed.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4 id="fcd07b8-244f-f746-5e62-551b22f0e223_Mass_Deleting_Via_List_View">Mass Deleting Via List View</h4>
    <p>Use the following steps to delete one or more inbound account records via the list view:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Navigate to the Inbound Email list view by clicking the Inbound Email module tab.</li>
        <li>Select the desired inbound account records individually or using the checkbox dropdown's options.</li>
        <li>Choose "Delete". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/af613f10-e87e-b062-8337-5503015fb359.png" alt="" width="195" height="133" /></li>
        <li>A pop-up message will display asking for confirmation. Click "Ok" to proceed.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Due to PHP memory limitations on the server, there may be occasions when the application times out while deleting a large number of inbound account records. If you encounter an error when performing this action, we recommend selecting the records in smaller batches.</p>
    <h3 id="fcd07b8-244f-f746-5e62-551b22f0e223_Creating_Cases_From_Email">Creating Cases From Email</h3>
    <p>To create a case via email, simply send an email to a group inbound email account that has the case creation option selected. The subject and description of the case is populated with the subject and body of the email respectively. The new case is assigned to the team defined in the inbound email account record and the case can be assigned to a specific user in that team based on two rules:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Round-Robin</strong> : Sugar distributes cases evenly among all users within the team.</li>
        <li><strong>Least-Busy</strong> : Sugar distributes cases to the least busy user within the team. Least busy is defined by the person with the least number of unread emails assigned to them.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Note</strong> : Case assignment is distributed to all members of the specified team, but excludes any inherited members of the team due to the "Reports To" structure. For more information on teams and the Reports To structure, please refer to the <a href="#a40-f304-eea1-4447-551b22d55799_Team_Management">Team Management</a> and <a href="#ec10f00-236f-9c84-9827-551b22807391_User_Fields">User Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide. <br />Cases created from email are automatically related to contact and account records that match the email address in the From field of the email. <br />If a case auto-reply template is specified the sender of the email will receive an email based on the template selected. The response contains the system generated case number in the subject line of the email based off of the case macro. The body of the email for which the case was created displays below the template text. The case auto-reply ignores the "No Auto-Reply to this Domain" field if populated. <br /><strong>Note</strong> : If both Auto-Reply and Case Auto-Reply templates are selected, Sugar will respond to the sender with the Case Auto-Reply template only.</p>
    <h2 id="fcd07b8-244f-f746-5e62-551b22f0e223_Email_Queue">Email Queue</h2>
    <p>The Email Queue option in Admin is where Sugar administrators can monitor and perform actions on queued email. When sending a campaign the emails are not sent immediately, but are queued to be sent. Each queued email has a "Send On" date and time set by the campaign they are sent from. The scheduler "Run Nightly Mass Email Campaigns" takes the queued emails that are ready to be sent based on this date and time and sends them in batches. If an email fails to send from the queue for any reason it will be flagged as a send attempt and, by default, Sugar will not attempt to send that email for another 24 hours. Once Sugar reaches six failed attempts to send an email it will be deleted from the queue. In order to send a failed email sooner than the default 24 hours, you can perform a <a href="#fcd07b8-244f-f746-5e62-551b22f0e223_Mass_Updating_Queued_Email">mass update</a> to reset the In Process field. This section will cover how to use the email queue as well as the various actions and options available from within the email queue.</p>

    <h3 id="fcd07b8-244f-f746-5e62-551b22f0e223_Searching_Queued_Email">Searching Queued Email</h3>
    <p>The email queue list view includes a Basic and Advanced Search to help you locate records easily and effectively in a module-specific manner. Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Email Queue list view below. Please note that Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %services). This will pull up any record that has the word "services" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends. <br />For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/03_Search#List_View_Search_%28Sidecar_Modules%29">Search</a> documentation.</p>
    <h4 id="fcd07b8-244f-f746-5e62-551b22f0e223_Basic_Search">Basic Search</h4>
    <p>Basic search offers a few, commonly used fields for a simplified search experience. From the Basic Search panel, you can click "Advanced Search" to access additional search functionality as needed. <br />The buttons and checkboxes available in Basic Search panel have the following functions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Search</strong> : Click the Search button or press your Return/Enter key to perform the search.</li>

To see all queued email records to which you have access, simply click "Clear" and then "Search" to perform a blank search with no filters.</p>
    <h4 id="fcd07b8-244f-f746-5e62-551b22f0e223_Advanced_Search">Advanced Search</h4>
    <p>Advanced Search offers a more in-depth search experience than Basic Search including additional fields, layout options, and saved search capability. From the Advanced search panel, you can click "Basic Search" for simplified searching. <br />The buttons, checkboxes, and dropdowns available in Advanced Search have the following functions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Search</strong> : Click the Search button or press your Return/Enter key to perform the search.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear</strong> : Click the Clear button to clear all criteria from the searchable fields.</li>
        <li><strong>Layout Options</strong> : Use the expandable Layout Options section to configure your list view.

For example, if you enter in a campaign name to search and a recipient name, Sugar will only return queued email records with matching both fields. Once the search completes, the relevant results will populate in the list view below the search panel. To see all queued email records to which you have access, simply click "Clear" and then "Search" to perform a blank search with no filters.</p>

    <p>List view displays the current search results broken into pages that you can scroll through rather than displaying potentially thousands of rows at once. To the right just below the search panel you can see which records of the total results set are currently being displayed. The two single-arrow Next and Previous buttons can be used to scroll through the records page-by-page. The two double-arrow First Page and Last Page buttons allow you to skip to the beginning or the end of your current results. <br />By default, Sugar displays 20 records per list view page, but administrators can change the number of records displayed via Admin &gt; System Settings. For more information on changing the number of displayed records, please refer to the <a href="#efc04ca-ebba-0f36-db59-551b22839419_fbcc0098-7ae9-b6e0-60c5-55b99e622112_User_Interface">System</a> documentation in the Administration guide.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/233f4f04-8594-aff3-a4a5-550300421754.png" alt="" width="561" height="109" /></p>

Alternatively, you can manually send a batch of emails in the queue. The amount of queued email that will be sent is equal to the "Number of emails sent per batch" value specified in the <a href="#fcd07b8-244f-f746-5e62-551b22f0e223_Campaign_Email_Settings">Campaign Email Settings</a>. <br />Use the following steps to manually send a batch of queued emails from the list view:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Navigate to the Email Queue list view by clicking the Email Queue link on the Admin page.</li>
        <li>Choose "Send Queued Campaign Emails" from below the list view. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/57425108-113b-2aec-43e6-55030080e550.png" alt="" width="270" height="262" /></li>
        <li>Sugar will then send a batch of queued email whose Send On date and time is equal to now or in the past. <br /><strong>Note</strong> : If an email fails to send it will not be tried again for 24 hours.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Selecting specific records and searching for specific records will not determine which queued emails will be sent. This process will send a batch of emails that are queued to be sent in order by the Send On field. For more information on setting the batch amount, please refer to the <a href="#fcd07b8-244f-f746-5e62-551b22f0e223_Campaign_Email_Settings">Campaign Email Settings</a> section. <br /><strong>Note</strong> : If your batch size is set high and you have a lot of queued email, this process can take a while to run through a single batch.</p>

<p>Sugar's Product Catalog module contains a list of all products or services that your organization sells. This module provides the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/16_Quoted_Line_Items">Quoted Line Items</a> and <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/125_Revenue_Line_Items">Revenue Line Items</a> modules with the template used when creating products to be used for <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/13_Opportunities">Opportunities</a> and <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/15_Quotes">Quotes</a>, including pricing and cost information and information about the <a href="#f421f4d9-bb87-42a3-8647-55539eecfc71_Manufacturers">manufacturer</a>.</p>
<p>Products within the Product Catalog can be broadly classified into <a href="#f421f4d9-bb87-42a3-8647-55539eecfc71_Product_Types">product types</a>, such as Software and Hardware. Each product type can be further organized into several <a href="#f421f4d9-bb87-42a3-8647-55539eecfc71_Product_Categories">product categories</a>. For example, the software product type can contain product categories such as Spreadsheets and Word Processors. You can also create sub-categories within a category.</p>

<p>There are various methods for creating products in the Product Catalog including via the Product Catalog module, duplication, and importing products. The full record view layout opens when creating the product directly from the Products menu and includes all of the relevant fields for your organization's products. The Record View layout can be configured via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on configuring layouts, please refer to the <a href="#f610ecf-f285-110a-1ef5-551b2291c5d7_Layouts">Studio</a> section of this documentation.</p>
<h4 id="f421f4d9-bb87-42a3-8647-55539eecfc71_Creating_Via_Product_Catalog">Creating Via Product Catalog</h4>
<p>One of the most common methods of product creation is via the Create Product for Catalog option in the Product Catalog module tab. This opens up the record view layout which allows you to enter in all the relevant information for the product. <br />Use the following steps to create a product via the Product Catalog module:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to Admin &gt; Product Catalog.</li>
    <li>Click the triangle in the Product Catalog module tab to open the actions menu and select "Create Product for Catalog". You can also click the Create button on the upper right of the Product Catalog list view. <br />From Product Catalog module tab: <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/7a692438-ec82-c233-cea8-5502ffeffedb.png" alt="" width="421" height="78" /><br />From Product Catalog list view: <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/42d5734f-73f7-de4f-bd96-5502ff0bc15b.png" alt="" width="424" height="125" /></li>
    <li>Enter appropriate values for the <a href="#f421f4d9-bb87-42a3-8647-55539eecfc71_Product_Catalog_Fields">fields</a> in the record view layout. All required fields are marked with a red asterisk and must be completed prior to saving.</li>
    <li>Once the necessary information is entered, click "Save".
        <ul>
            <li>Alternatively, you can use the Actions Menu to the right of the Save button to select "Save and view" or "Save and create new". "Save and view" will display the record's details after the save is complete. "Save and create new" saves the current record and opens a new, blank record view in edit mode where you can create another record.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="f421f4d9-bb87-42a3-8647-55539eecfc71_Creating_Via_Duplication">Creating Via Duplication</h4>
<p>You can also create a new product for the catalog by duplicating an existing record. The duplicate option is useful if the product you are creating has similar information to an existing product.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to create a product for the catalog by duplicating an existing record:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to a product catalog record's record view.</li>
    <li>Click the Actions menu and select "Duplicate". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/eb260d74-a788-2713-bc05-5502ffb1d2e5.png" alt="" width="475" height="186" /></li>
    <li>The displayed record view is pre-populated with the original product's values. Update the necessary fields, then click "Save".
        <ul>
            <li>Alternatively, you can use the Actions Menu to the right of the Save button to select "Save and view" or "Save and create new". "Save and view" will display the record's details after the save is complete. "Save and create new" saves the current record and opens a new, blank record view in edit mode where you can create another record.</li>

    <li>In Step 1, select the import file and choose "Create new records only". Click "Next".</li>
    <li>In Step 2, confirm the import file properties. Click "Next".</li>
    <li>In Step 3, confirm the field mappings for the import. Click "Next".</li>

<h3 id="f421f4d9-bb87-42a3-8647-55539eecfc71_Searching_Product_Catalog">Searching Product Catalog</h3>
<p>The Product Catalog list view includes a Module Search to help you locate records easily and effectively in a module-specific manner. Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Product Catalog list view below. Please note that Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %widgets). This will pull up any record that has the word "widgets" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p>
<p>For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/03_Search">Search</a> documentation.</p>
<h4 id="f421f4d9-bb87-42a3-8647-55539eecfc71_Module_Search">Module Search</h4>
<p>Module search enables users to easily search by product catalog name within the Product Catalog module and pull up matching records in the list view. The search also provides a Filter option which can be used in combination with the open Search box to narrow your search further using the available options as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Create</strong> : Create a new custom filter which you can use to filter your search
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Note</strong>: You can also click "Create" to the right of the Filter option.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>All Product Catalog</strong> : Returns all records in the module to which you have access</li>
    <li><strong>Recently Created </strong>: Returns only records you created in the module within the last 7 days</li>
    <li><strong>Recently Viewed </strong>: Returns only records you have viewed in the module within the last 7 days</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/cafa67c6-d30c-84a7-c2d3-5502ffade1ee.png" alt="" height="207" width="473" /><br />When you choose a filter, Sugar will return records which match both the selected filter and any name provided in the "Search by product name..." bar in the filtered list view results. For example, if you select "Recently Created" and enter a product catalog name, Sugar will only return product catalog records with a matching name that you created within the last 7 days. Once the search is complete, the relevant results will populate in the <a href="#f421f4d9-bb87-42a3-8647-55539eecfc71_Product_Catalog_List_View">list view</a> below the search panel. To see all product catalog records to which you have access, simply select the All Product Catalog in the filter and remove any text from the search bar. You can also click the Clear icon within the selected filter option (e.g. Recently Created) in the Search bar to clear the filter and pull up all list view search results. When you run a search using a saved or created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter.

<p>Users can also create new filters via the Create option in the Filter list of the search bar. This allows you to add custom, complex filter options when searching in the Product Catalog list view. You have the option to add multiple fields to your new filter by clicking the Plus button to the right of the filter selection dropdown lists and set select operators along with their value(s). A filter's criteria need to be true for a record in order for it to appear in the list view search result. Additionally, filters with no specified values may be saved as a custom filter to act as a filter template when a user often searches using the same fields but with varying values. Please note that only fields you have view access for will appear in the Filter list when creating a search filter.</p>
<p>When you run a search using a created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away.</p>
<p>The following steps cover creating a new Date Available filter as an example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click the Filter option on the Product Catalog search bar then select "Create". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8e9903d8-862e-2dc4-c8b4-5502fffcabe5.png" alt="" width="343" height="217" /></li>
    <li>Select the field you wish to add to your filter as well as the condition and matching criteria.</li>
    <li>To add additional fields to the new filter, click the Plus button to the right of the filter.
        <ul>
            <li>To remove fields from the new filter, click the Minus button to the right of the filter.</li>
            <li>To clear any filter values, simply click the "x" to the right of the value (if applicable) or select "Reset" to the left of the Save button.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Beginning with version 6.5.0, Full Text Search may be used with Global Search to search throughout nearly all fields and modules for an enhanced search experience. The Global Search bar is located on the top right hand side of Sugar. You can click the magnifying glass icon or hit Return/Enter to perform your search once the text string is entered in the search box.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e2b8a7e3-736e-3a22-5dbb-5502ff43b2ea.png" alt="" width="353" height="47" /></p>
<p>To use global search, you need to first enter the keyword into the search box. With Full Text Search enabled, pop-up results will begin appearing once you input three or more characters. Clicking the magnifying glass icon or hitting your Return/Enter key will cause Sugar to return exact matches for your keyword rather than matches with words beginning with your keyword. When Full Text Search is not enabled, results starting with your keyword will appear after clicking the magnifying glass icon or hitting your Return/Enter key. For more information on using and configuring Global Search, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/03_Search#Global_Search">Global Search</a> section of the Search documentation.</p>
<p>Regular Sugar users can configure some aspects of global search such as what modules are displayed in the search results. For more information on configuring your Global Search, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/03_Search#Advanced_Options">Search</a> documentation. Administrators can control additional elements of global search via Admin &gt; Search and Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on administrator configuration of Global Search, please refer to the <a href="#f610ecf-f285-110a-1ef5-551b2291c5d7_14e9e048-86c8-14a4-12ba-55b99e8774da_Fields">Studio</a> documentation as well as the <a href="#efc04ca-ebba-0f36-db59-551b22839419_Search">Search</a> section of the System documentation.</p>

<p>List view provides the ability to reorder columns by dragging and dropping the title of the column to the desired location. The new column order will remain for a user upon subsequent visits to the module until the user's browser cache is cleared. You can reset the column order back to the default view by clicking the Gear icon to the far right of the list view column headers and selecting "Reset default view". Please note that this option only appears if the current list view column order is different from the default column order.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8bc70d61-08a2-cda4-014e-5502ff53c662.png" alt="" width="609" height="201" /></p>

<p>Users can easily adjust the size of columns in the Product Catalog list view per their viewing preference. Simply place your cursor on the column divider, and when the Left and Right arrow appears, click and drag the column to the desired size. The set column width will be preserved when you navigate away from the page. Sugar will render the preferred column size across sessions until the user removes or resets the relevant browser cookies. You can reset the column width back to the default size by clicking the Gear icon to the far right of the list view column headers and selecting "Reset default widths". Please note that this option only appears if at least one of the column widths in the current list view is different from the default column width. Changes to the column width made by administrators in Studio are only respected if the user has not resized the specific column in the list view. The column size set by the user will supersede the default column width configured in Studio until the user resets the list view back to the default widths.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5cd17008-8b99-cdd2-3307-5502ff875b79.png" alt="" width="698" height="234" /></p>

<p>An intelligence pane displays to the right of the product catalog's record view and can provide users with valuable information via various dashlets. The Help dashboard normally displays by default along with the Record View Help dashlet and Learning Resources dashlet. The Record View Help dashlet provides users with a brief introduction to the module along with some instructions to help users utilize and navigate around the record view. A link to the corresponding documentation (e.g. Product Catalog documentation) in the Administration guide is also provided within the Help dashlet. The Learning Resources dashlet includes links to Sugar University, Community Forums, and Documentation &amp; Support, which provide access to additional resources. Simply click the appropriate link to be directed to the specific page in a separate tab. For more information regarding the Help dashboard, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/02_User_Interface/15_Intelligence_Pane/#Viewing_Via_Record_View">Intelligence Pane</a> documentation. Users may create other dashboards (e.g. My Dashboard) for use with the Product Catalog module by clicking the Create button. Selecting "Edit" from the Actions menu on the upper right will allow them to make changes and add additional dashlets to their dashboards.</p>
<p>Users can edit individual dashlets by clicking the Gear icon on the upper right of each dashlet. Dashlets may also be dragged and dropped to rearrange them within the current dashboard. You can collapse dashlets you do no wish to view by clicking the Up arrow on the upper right of the dashlet.

<p>Between multiple users working in Sugar, importing new records, and converting leads, it is possible for duplicate product records to be accidentally input to the system. Before creating a new product record, a good practice is to first check that the product does not already exist in Sugar. You can locate duplicate records for cleanup using <a href="#f421f4d9-bb87-42a3-8647-55539eecfc71_d6291de7-9c32-cc43-55b7-55b99e7d2e04_Module_Search">module search</a> from the Product Catalogs list view. Searching for products with similar names or other information can turn search into a powerful, duplicates-finding tool. Sugar also provides a wizard for finding potential duplicates that is available from the Product Catalogs record view and may be used as shown below. If duplicate product records are detected, you can perform a merge per the <a href="#f421f4d9-bb87-42a3-8647-55539eecfc71_Merging_Products">Merging Products</a> section of this documentation.</p>
<p>Please note that your ability to use the Find Duplicates action may be restricted by any role which prevents product deletion. For more information on roles, please refer to the <a href="#fdc0792-a630-699f-112c-551b22b26707_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation. Check with the system administrator if you do not see the Find Duplicates option.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to locate duplicate products using the Find Duplicates option from the Product Catalogss record view:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to a product's record view.</li>
    <li>Choose "Find Duplicates" from the Actions menu. <br /><span><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/192f0b2d-fe09-5404-4902-5502ff99c462.png" alt="" width="440" height="180" /></span></li>
    <li>Potential duplicate product records will be listed on the Find Duplicates page. Select the duplicate record(s) you wish to merge then click "Merge Duplicates".
        <ul>
            <li>You can preview the duplicate record's details by clicking the Preview button to the far right of the records row.</li>
            <li>You can search for specific records from the Product Catalogs list view if you wish to check for more possible duplicates. For more information on performing a search, please refer to the <a href="#f421f4d9-bb87-42a3-8647-55539eecfc71_d6291de7-9c32-cc43-55b7-55b99e7d2e04_Module_Search">Module Search</a> section of this documentation.</li>

</ol>
<p>Once you click "Merge Duplicates", the merging process with the current record will begin. For instructions on performing the merge that follows, please refer to Steps 3-9 of the <a href="#f421f4d9-bb87-42a3-8647-55539eecfc71_d688bf2d-81f9-1cd3-f3cb-55b99e15aa22_Merging_Via_List_View">Merging Via List View</a> section of this documentation.</p>

<p>When duplicate records are identified in Sugar, you have the option to merge two or more products into a single record. Once the merge is complete, the duplicate product record(s) will be deleted, and the primary record will remain. Please note that all relationships belonging to the duplicate products will be merged to the primary record meaning that any calls, meetings, cases, etc. related to the duplicate product record(s) will automatically be related to the resulting, merged product record.</p>

<p>Product categories can be created either via the Product Categories module or by importing categories. When creating via the Product Categories module, the full record view layout opens and includes all of the relevant fields for your categories.</p>
<h4 id="f421f4d9-bb87-42a3-8647-55539eecfc71_Creating_Via_Product_Categories_Module">Creating Via Product Categories Module</h4>
<p>One of the most common methods of product category creation is via the Product Categories module using the Create button on the list view. This opens the record view layout which allows you to enter all of the relevant information for the product category.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to create a product category via the Product Categories module:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to Admin &gt; Product Categories and click the Create button on the upper right of the list view. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/143fe766-30cd-baf2-e8a8-5502ffa76ae4.png" alt="" width="450" height="195" /></li>
    <li>Enter appropriate values for the <a href="#f421f4d9-bb87-42a3-8647-55539eecfc71_Product_Category_Fields">fields</a> in the record view layout. All required fields will indicate "Required" in the field and must be completed prior to saving.</li>
    <li>Once the necessary information is entered, click "Save".
        <ul>
            <li>Alternatively, you can use the Actions Menu to the right of the Save button to select "Save and view" or "Save and create new". "Save and view" will display the record's details after the save is complete. "Save and create new" saves the current record and opens a new, blank record view in edit mode where you can create another record.</li>
        </ul><br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/3ff5a38e-a367-c4aa-dafa-5502ff717610.png" alt="" width="450" height="51" /></li>

<p>You can also create a new product category by duplicating an existing product category record. The Copy option is useful if the product category you are creating has similar information to an existing product category.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to create a product category by duplicating an existing record:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to a product category's record view.</li>
    <li>Click the Actions menu and select "Copy". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/46e808b2-fcc8-3c3b-95ff-5502ff5dc09c.png" alt="" width="410" height="196" /></li>
    <li>The displayed record view is pre-populated with the original product category's values. Update the necessary fields, then click "Save".
        <ul>
            <li>Please note that you can also click the Actions Menu to the right of the Save button to select the "Save and view" or "Save and create new" options. Save and view will display the record's details after the save is complete. The Save and create new option saves the current record and opens a new, blank record view in edit mode where the user can create another record.</li>

<div>
    <div>
        <div>
            <p>The Product Categories list view includes a module search to help you locate records easily and effectively in a module-specific manner. Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Product Categories list view below. Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Please note that Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %widgets). This will pull up any record that has the word "widgets" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p>
            <p>For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/03_Search">Search</a> documentation.</p>

                <p>Module search enables users to easily search by product category name within the Product Categories module and pull up matching records in the list view. The search also provides a Filter option which can be used in combination with the open Search box to narrow your search further using the available options as follows:</p>

                <p>When you choose a filter, Sugar will return product categories which match both the selected filter and any name provided in the "Search by product category..." bar in the filtered list view results. For example, if you select "Recently Created" in the Filter options and enter a product category name, Sugar will only return records with a matching name that was created within the last 7 days. Once the search is complete, the relevant results will populate in the <a href="#f421f4d9-bb87-42a3-8647-55539eecfc71_Product_Categories_List_View">list view</a> below the search bar. To see all product category records to which you have access, simply select the All Product Categories option in the filter and remove any text from the search bar. You can also click the Clear icon within the selected filter option (e.g. Recently Created) in the Search bar to clear the filter and pull up all list view search results. When you run a search using a saved or created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d99d8f14-8599-05f8-1784-5502ff6f46ae.png" alt="" width="391" height="142" /></p>
                <p>Please note that you will only be able to see product category records as allowed by your user access type (Developer) and assigned roles. For more information on roles, please refer to the <a href="#fdc0792-a630-699f-112c-551b22b26707_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation.</p>

            <div>
                <p>You can also create new filters via the Create option in the Filter list of the search bar. This allows users to add custom, complex filter options when searching in the Product Categories list view. You have the option to add multiple fields to your new filter by clicking the Plus button to the right of the filter selection dropdown lists and set select operators along with their value(s). A filter's criteria need to be true for a record in order for it to appear in the list view search result. Additionally, filters with no specified values may be saved as a custom filter to act as a filter template when a user often searches using the same fields but with varying values.</p>
                <p><strong>Note</strong>: For users with Developer lever access, only fields you have view access for will appear in the Filter list when creating a search filter.</p>
                <p>When you run a search using a created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away.</p>

            <h3 id="f421f4d9-bb87-42a3-8647-55539eecfc71_Global_Search">Global Search</h3>
            <p>Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Beginning with version 6.5.0, Full Text Search is used with Global Search to search throughout nearly all fields and modules for an enhanced search experience. The Global Search bar is located on the top right hand side of Sugar. You can click the magnifying glass icon or hit Return/Enter to perform your search once the text string is entered in the search box.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e2b8a7e3-736e-3a22-5dbb-5502ff43b2ea.png" alt="" width="335" height="45" /></p>
            <p>To use global search, you need to first enter the keyword into the search box and the pop-up results will begin appearing once you enter in at least one character. Clicking the magnifying glass icon or hitting your Return/Enter key will cause Sugar to return exact matches for your keyword rather than matches with words beginning with your keyword. For more information on using and configuring Global Search, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/03_Search/#Global_Search">Global Search</a> section of the Search documentation.</p>
            <p>Regular Sugar users can configure some aspects of global search such as what modules are displayed in the search results by clicking the down arrow within the search box then selecting the module(s) to include in the search. For more information on configuring your Global Search, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/03_Search/#Advanced_Options">Search</a> documentation. Administrators can control additional elements of global search via Admin &gt; Search and Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on administrator configuration of Global Search, please refer to the <a href="#f610ecf-f285-110a-1ef5-551b2291c5d7_Field_Options">Field Options</a> section of the Studio documentation as well as the <a href="#efc04ca-ebba-0f36-db59-551b22839419_Search">Search</a> section of the System documentation.</p>

<p>List view provides the ability to reorder columns by dragging and dropping the title of the column to the desired location. The new column order will remain for a user upon subsequent visits to the module until the user's browser cache is cleared. You can reset the column order back to the default view by clicking the Gear icon to the far right of the list view column headers and selecting "Reset default view". Please note that this option only appears if the current list view column order is different from the default column order.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8bc70d61-08a2-cda4-014e-5502ff53c662.png" alt="" width="609" height="201" /></p>

<p>Users can easily adjust the size of columns in the Product Categories list view per their viewing preference. Simply place your cursor on the column divider, and when the Left and Right arrow appears, click and drag the column to the desired size. The set column width will be preserved when you navigate away from the page. Sugar will render the preferred column size across sessions until the user removes or resets the relevant browser cookies. You can reset the column width back to the default size by clicking the Gear icon to the far right of the list view column headers and selecting "Reset default widths". Please note that this option only appears if at least one of the column widths in the current list view is different from the default column width. Changes to the column width made by administrators in Studio are only respected if the user has not resized the specific column in the list view. The column size set by the user will supersede the default column width configured in Studio until the user resets the list view back to the default widths.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5cd17008-8b99-cdd2-3307-5502ff875b79.png" alt="" width="698" height="234" /></p>

A link to the corresponding documentation (e.g. Product Categories documentation) in the Administration guide is also provided within the Help dashlet. The Learning Resources dashlet includes links to Sugar University, Community Forums, and Documentation &amp; Support, which provide access to additional resources. Simply click the appropriate link to be directed to the specific page in a separate tab. For more information regarding the Help dashboard, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/02_User_Interface/15_Intelligence_Pane/#Viewing_Via_Record_View">Intelligence Pane</a> documentation.

<p>Sugar's Export option allows users to download all fields for the selected product categories to their computers as a .CSV (comma-separated values) file. This may be useful when needing to use Product Category data with other software such as Microsoft Excel or to update existing records by exporting, making changes, then importing the altered product categories back into Sugar. For more information on updating existing records via import, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/52_Import/#Importing_Updates_to_Existing_Records">Import</a> documentation. Due to PHP memory limitations on the server, there may be occasions when the application times out while exporting a large number of records. If you encounter an error when performing this action, we recommend selecting the records in smaller batches.</p>
<p>Product Categories may be exported from the Product Categories list view by selecting "Export" from the Actions menu. Users with access to the Reports module also have the option of creating or accessing reports containing specifically chosen fields for product categories and their related record(s). Please note that only Rows and Columns-type reports have the ability to be exported. For more information on exporting records in Sugar, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/51_Export">Export</a> documentation. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/4587a857-d98d-45a5-f7d2-5502ff1e9efb.png" alt="" width="361" height="207" /></p>
<p>Please note that your ability to export product categories from Sugar may be restricted by a role. For more information on roles, please refer to the <a href="#fdc0792-a630-699f-112c-551b22b26707_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation.

<h3 id="f421f4d9-bb87-42a3-8647-55539eecfc71_Finding_Duplicate_Product_Categories">Finding Duplicate Product Categories</h3>
<p>Between multiple users working in Sugar and importing new records, it is possible for duplicate product category records to be accidentally input to the system. Before creating a new product category record, a good practice is to first check that the product category does not already exist in Sugar. You can locate duplicate records for cleanup using <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/08_Products_and_Quotes/index.html#Module_Search_2">module search</a> from the Product Categories list view. Searching for product categories with similar names or other information can turn search into a powerful, duplicates-finding tool. Sugar also provides a wizard for finding potential duplicates that is available from the Product Categories record view and may be used as shown below. If duplicate product category records are detected, you can perform a merge per the <a href="#f421f4d9-bb87-42a3-8647-55539eecfc71_Merging_Product_Categories">Merging Product Categories</a> section of this documentation.</p>
<p>Please note that your ability to use the Find Duplicates action may be restricted by any role which prevents record deletion. For more information on roles, please refer to the <a href="#fdc0792-a630-699f-112c-551b22b26707_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation. Check with the system administrator if you do not see the Find Duplicates option.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to locate duplicate product categories using the Find Duplicates option from the Product Categories record view:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to a product category's record view.</li>
    <li>Choose "Find Duplicates" from the Actions menu. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e2e7b43e-8970-6ded-5c06-5502ff209dab.png" alt="" width="436" height="164" /></li>
    <li>Potential duplicate product category records will be listed on the Find Duplicates page. Select the duplicate record(s) you wish to merge then click "Merge Duplicates".
        <ul>
            <li>You can preview the duplicate record's details by clicking the Preview button to the far right of the records row.</li>
            <li>You can search for specific records from the Product Categories list view if you wish to check for more possible duplicates. For more information on performing a search, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/08_Products_and_Quotes/index.html#Module_Search_2">Module Search</a> section of this documentation.</li>

    <p>In <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/42_Bugs">Bug Tracker</a>, there are two dropdown fields, "Found in Release" and "Fixed in Release", that cannot be edited though normal means. Although these are dropdown fields, they do not show a <a href="#f4705b1-3dc4-c8e4-5ca9-551b22b4cbe1_Dropdown_Editor">dropdown list</a> option in Dropdown Editor to add, remove, and edit the dropdown options.</p>

    <p>The release dropdown list is instead controlled by the Releases section of the Admin menu. The release list is more comprehensive than a standard dropdown list, so each list option needs additional information. This documentation will cover how to use the Releases section of the Admin menu and make changes to the list that controls these fields.</p>
    <h2 id="fea0113-ec84-8689-f1c5-551b22d23e09_Release_Fields">Release Fields</h2> The Releases module contains three fields which come out-of-the-box with Sugar. These fields are not found in Studio, and therefore cannot be edited.<br />

        <li>Click one of your two save options. Both will store your new record and have it available for use through Sugar. However, the behavior after clicking is dependent on which button used:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Save : </strong>After clicking "Save", the same release option that you created will remain editable for you to make additional changes if need be, after appearing on the list view above.</li>
                <li><strong>Save &amp; Create New :</strong> After clicking "Save &amp; Create New", the release appears on the list view, the edit form's "Release Version" field is cleared out, and the "Order" field is increased by one. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a871c6ed-06b8-ab43-5ab3-550300ab0228.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a871c6ed-06b8-ab43-5ab3-550300ab0228.png" width="232" height="155" /></li>

    <p>All of the release options are shown on a list view in the Releases module. Due to the Releases module only containing three fields, all of the necessary details are shown on this list view. The list view is always available when viewing the Releases module, and specific releases can be selected from the list, but records can also be selected via the Recently Viewed section of the module tab.</p>
    <h3 id="fea0113-ec84-8689-f1c5-551b22d23e09_Viewing_Via_Module">Viewing Via Module</h3>
    <p>To view all of the releases, navigate to Admin &gt; Releases. The list view displays with all currently available releases within Sugar. The list view can be ordered by any of the three <a href="#fea0113-ec84-8689-f1c5-551b22d23e09_Release_Fields">fields</a> within Releases. To see additional releases, use the arrows in the top right of the list view to scroll through available pages. Here, you can see which records of the total amount of releases are currently being displayed. The two single-arrow Next and Previous buttons can be used to scroll through the records page-by-page. The two double-arrow First Page and Last Page buttons allow you to skip to the beginning or the end of the list.</p>
    <p>From this list, any of the releases can be clicked and either <a href="#fea0113-ec84-8689-f1c5-551b22d23e09_Editing_Releases">edited</a> or <a href="#fea0113-ec84-8689-f1c5-551b22d23e09_Deleting_Releases">deleted</a>. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e2285143-1ed6-f56d-ae69-550300d4e3bd.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e2285143-1ed6-f56d-ae69-550300d4e3bd.png" width="546" height="152" /></p>

    <h2 id="fea0113-ec84-8689-f1c5-551b22d23e09_Editing_Releases">Editing Releases</h2>
    <p>Changes to releases can be made at the discretion of any admin at any time. To make changes, such as changing the name of the release and how it shows in the Bug Tracker module, whether the release value is active or not, or the order in which the releases display, the release record needs to just be accessed via the list view. Follow these steps to edit releases:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Navigate to Admin &gt; Releases.</li>
        <li>Select the release that you would like to edit by clicking the release name. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/1ee0ca75-1400-59e5-904c-550300e0392f.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/1ee0ca75-1400-59e5-904c-550300e0392f.png" width="424" height="192" /></li>
        <li>This will open the editor below the list view for the specific record where you can make the necessary changes. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/dd802771-9700-eb77-c543-550300167eeb.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/dd802771-9700-eb77-c543-550300167eeb.png" width="571" height="134" /></li>
        <li>Click one of your two save options. Both will store your updates to the record. However, the behavior after clicking is dependent on which button used:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Save : </strong>After clicking "Save", the same release option that you edited will remain editable for you to make additional changes if need be, after the changes update on the list view above.</li>
                <li><strong>Save &amp; Create New :</strong> After clicking "Save &amp; Create New", the changes to the release appear on the list view, the edit form defaults back to <a href="#fea0113-ec84-8689-f1c5-551b22d23e09_Creating_Releases">creating a new record</a>.</li>
            </ul>

    </ol>
    <h2 id="fea0113-ec84-8689-f1c5-551b22d23e09_Deleting_Releases">Deleting Releases</h2></div>
<p>If a release option is invalid or should no longer appear in your organization's Sugar instance, it may be deleted from the Releases list view. Deleting release options will not delete the bugs that use them. Instead, if a bug's "Found in Release" or "Fixed in Release" field was filled in with the deleted release, the field will now be blank. Use the following steps to delete a release option from the Bug Tracker:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to Admin &gt; Releases.</li>
    <li>Click the Delete button corresponding to the release that you would like deleted. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/c725f811-1654-54d4-2e2b-550300389c22.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/c725f811-1654-54d4-2e2b-550300389c22.png" width="333" height="163" /></li>
    <li>The page will refresh and the option will now be removed from the list view, as well as any references in the Bug Tracker.</li>

<h2 id="e7609cd-3b78-4643-026f-551b22d9d349_Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Sugar provides the option to track opportunities and build forecasts at two different levels of granularity. Admins can choose to use opportunities alone or opportunities in combination with revenue line items.</p>
<p>When working with opportunities alone, each opportunity record will track the progress and total value of an entire potential business deal. The same total deal values will be available when building forecasts.</p>
<p>As an alternative, opportunities used in conjunction with revenue line items track the values of the individual line items of a deal in revenue line item records. Each opportunity, then, is a parent record to a set of revenue line item records. The opportunity stores the summed values of all of its related line items.</p>
<p>Sugar Admins can choose which opportunity model makes the most sense for their organization via Admin &gt; Opportunities.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/31620f38-f47d-bc72-e5b5-5503003359eb.png" alt="" width="357" height="36" /></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Changing your instance's opportunity model via Admin &gt; Opportunities will cause all existing forecasting data to be lost. Forecasting must begin anew after the switch has made and the notifications have been received indicating the completion of the back-end tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Switching to use opportunities only will cause all workflows involving the Revenue Line Items module to be deleted from your instance. Making a change to this setting in either direction (i.e. choosing opportunities only or opportunities with revenue line items) will cause all workflows involving the Opportunities module to be disabled. Please review your workflows after making this change to ensure any necessary workflows are set up with the relevant modules.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Changing your instance's opportunity model may cause process definitions (Admin &gt; Process Author) based on the Opportunities or Revenue Line Items to cease functioning as expected. Affected process definitions should be recreated using the correct fields (e.g. Sales Stage for opportunities-only forecasting or Status for opportunities-and-revenue-line-items forecasting).</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Changing your instance's opportunity model from "Opportunities and Revenue Line Items" to "Opportunities" will cause Revenue Line Items-based dashlets (e.g. My Revenue Line Items dashlet) to no longer work. Users will need to remove these dashlets from their dashboards to avoid any unexpected behavior. </p>

<p>In the Opportunities section of the Admin panel, you have the ability to change how your instance tracks opportunities and forecasting. You can change from using opportunities only to <a href="#e7609cd-3b78-4643-026f-551b22d9d349_Moving_to_Opportunities_With_Revenue_Line_Items">using opportunities with revenue line items</a> or from using opportunities with revenue line items to <a href="#e7609cd-3b78-4643-026f-551b22d9d349_Moving_to_Opportunities_Only">opportunities by themselves</a>.</p>

<p>Moving to the "Opportunities with Revenue Line Items" model will mean all sales are tracked as opportunities with a revenue line item record for each line item of the sale. An opportunity consists of one or more revenue line items. This affords sales to be detailed in separate line items and summarized in an opportunity. Forecasts will be created based on revenue line items.</p>
<p>Changing the setting from "Opportunities" to "Opportunities and RevenueLineItems" will result in existing data being changed, added, and removed as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your existing opportunities will each have one revenue line items created and attached to the opportunity.</li>
    <li>The following fields and values will be duplicated from the existing opportunity records to the new revenue line items records:
        <ul>
            <li>Likely Amount, Best Amount, Worst Amount</li>
            <li>Expected Close Date</li>
            <li>Next Step</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The following fields and values will be moved from the existing opportunity records to the new revenue line item records:

            <li>Sales Stage</li>
            <li>Probability</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>All forecasting data will be removed and forecasting starts anew.</li>
</ul>
<p>After you initiate this change, revenue line item records will be created for each existing opportunity in the background. When the revenue line items are complete and available, a notification will appear in your <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/02_User_Interface/#Notifications">Notifications indicator</a> and an email will be sent to the email address on your user profile.

<div>In order to change from "Opportunities and Revenue Line Items" to "Opportunities", click the radio button marked "Opportunities". An additional option will appear for controlling the resulting opportunities' Expected Close Date fields. If existing opportunities have multiple revenue line items with differing Expected Close Date values, you must specify if the resulting opportunities should take the earliest or the latest close dates from the revenue line items. After making this selection, click "Save". A warning dialog will appear that must be confirmed before the change will be made.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/484374ee-92e4-dbf2-0b74-5503004352ab.png" alt="" width="440" height="182" /></div>

<p>Moving to the "Opportunities" model means that all sales and forecasting will be tracked as opportunities, and revenue line items will not be available.</p>
<p>Changing the setting from "Opportunities and Revenue Line Items" to "Opportunities" will result in existing data being changed, added, and removed as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>In addition to the information already summarized in each Opportunity, the following information from the Revenue Line Items will be will be saved in the Opportunity:
        <ul>
            <li>If all Revenue Line Items are in the "Closed Lost" Sales Stage, the Opportunity will be marked as "Closed Lost"</li>
            <li>If all Revenue Line Items are closed and at least one was won, the Opportunity will be marked as "Closed Won"</li>
            <li>If any of the Revenue Line Items are still open, the Opportunity will be marked with the least-advanced sales stage.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>A Note record will be created and attached to the Opportunity to preserve the individual Revenue Line Items values for the following fields:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>Likely Amount, Best Amount, Worst Amount</li>

    <p>Sugar's Forecasts module incorporates revenue line item records to build forecasting worksheets and predict sales. Users can work towards sales quotas at the individual, team, and sales organization level. Before users may access the Forecasts module to begin building forecasting worksheets, a user with administrator access must configure the Forecasts module with the organization's desired Time Periods, Ranges, Scenarios, and Worksheet Columns.</p>
    <h2 id="fbd0b77-0516-21e4-d5d3-551b223748cd_Configuring_Forecasts">Configuring Forecasts</h2>
    <p>Administrator users can access the Forecast configuration settings by navigating to the Administration page and clicking the Forecasts link. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/686942bb-62c2-49b9-aed3-550289ef5313.png" alt="" width="350" height="44" /></p>
    <p>As an alternative, administrators can also access the Forecast configuration settings by navigating to the Forecasts module. Clicking the Forecasts module tab before the module has been configured will automatically redirect administrators to the configuration wizard. After the module has been configured, they are able to choose "Settings" from the Actions menu within the Forecasts module to review their configuration selections and potentially make changes. For more information on making changes to the configuration, please refer to the <a href="#fbd0b77-0516-21e4-d5d3-551b223748cd_Editing_Forecast_Configurations">Editing Forecast Configurations</a> section of this documentation. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/52841ad6-9bde-5544-811d-5502ff00a333.png" alt="" width="230" height="131" /></p>
    <p>The Forecasts Setup wizard will guide you through the various configuration items.</p>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: The Forecast Time Periods cannot be changed after initial setup without losing all existing Forecast data. The Forecast Ranges cannot be changed after the first Save Draft or Commit action in the Forecasts module. In order to make changes to these selections, please refer to the <a href="#fbd0b77-0516-21e4-d5d3-551b223748cd_Editing_Forecast_Configurations">Editing Forecast Configurations</a> section of this documentation.</p>

    <p>The Time Periods panel allows you to match the Forecasts module's fiscal year and frequency of quota cycles to your organization's practices. These settings will control the beginning and duration of your forecasting time periods as well as control the number of past and future time periods users may access.</p>
    <p>Use the following steps to configure Forecast Time Periods:</p>

        <li>Select the Time Period type which matches your sales organization's practices. Choose "Yearly" if your sales organization has quarterly quotas which build up to a yearly goal. Choose "Quarterly" if you operate with monthly goals building to quarterly goals instead. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/31fc4127-f041-934e-c011-5502ff5291a6.png" alt="" width="400" height="117" /></li>

You must specify which of those two years the start date applies to. In these cases, a dropdown will appear prompting you to select the appropriate fiscal year. For example, if the start date of the fiscal year is 07/01/2014, the end date will be 06/30/2015. The forecast wizard will therefore ask you if the time period 07/01/2014 -06/30/2015 should be considered fiscal year 2014 or fiscal year 2015.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a2860141-1007-0824-44d3-5502ff9884d3.png" alt="" width="407" height="245" /><br /><strong>Note:</strong> It is not recommended to choose February 29th for the fiscal year start date, though this is possible to do during a leap year.

    <h3 id="fbd0b77-0516-21e4-d5d3-551b223748cd_Ranges">Ranges</h3>
    <p>Forecast Ranges are a method of predefining what revenue line item records should likely be included on forecasts and which should not. As the administrator, you will specify the sale probabilities which will cause revenue line items to be initially included on a user's forecast. Each user, however, can then manually choose to include or exclude their revenue line items no matter how the probabilities line up with these ranges.</p>
    <p>In addition to initially including revenue line items, these ranges will also be available to users in the Forecasts module as categories for filtering or for grouping in charts. Ranges which are not associated with probabilities and are used strictly for categorical purposes may be added under the Custom Ranges option.</p>
    <h4 id="fbd0b77-0516-21e4-d5d3-551b223748cd_Two_Ranges">Two Ranges</h4>
    <p>Choose the Two Ranges radio button for a simple include or exclude model. You will then drag the left slider to specify the minimum probabilities that qualify a revenue line item to be initially included on forecasts. In this two-range model, all revenue line items with probabilities falling below the defined range will be initially excluded from forecasts. Choosing "Two Ranges" will cause the categories "Include" and "Exclude" to be available for users in the Forecasts module for filtering or grouping revenue line items in charts. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/1f8bddbb-d770-1762-e970-550289f0bbb1.png" alt="" height="211" width="428" /></p>
    <h4 id="fbd0b77-0516-21e4-d5d3-551b223748cd_Three_Ranges">Three Ranges</h4>
    <p>Choose the Three Ranges radio button to enable an intermediate range. Drag the left Include slider to specify the minimum probabilities that qualify a revenue line item to be predefined as included on forecasts. Then use the Upside sliders to define the range of probabilities which will be initially excluded from forecasts but which can be viewed independently for consideration for inclusion by the user. All revenue line items with probabilities falling outside these two ranges will also be predefined as excluded from forecasts. Choosing "Three Ranges" will cause the categories "Include", "Upside", and "Exclude" to be available for users in the Forecasts module for filtering revenue line items in charts. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/6b743e11-00ab-8a87-edcf-5502891ca3f0.png" alt="" height="320" width="605" /></p>
    <h4 id="fbd0b77-0516-21e4-d5d3-551b223748cd_Custom_Ranges">Custom Ranges</h4>
    <p>Choose the Custom Ranges radio button if you would like to create additional, more customized ranges. Custom ranges based on probabilities will be used to initially determine whether or not a revenue line item is included or excluded in forecasts.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Include and Exclude ranges are required, though you may change their names if desired.</li>
        <li>Use the plus button to add additional ranges.</li>
        <li>Use the minus button to remove unwanted ranges.</li>
        <li>Use the text box to specify the desired name for each range.</li>
        <li>Mark the check box of every range which should be included on forecasting worksheets.</li>
        <li>Use each range's sliders to determine the minimum and maximum probabilities which will correlate with each range.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You may also add custom ranges not based on probability at the bottom of the ranges panel. These values do not correlate with any probabilities, and revenue line items marked with these range options will not be included on forecasting worksheets. Ranges created in this section may be used as tags on the revenue line item record.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the plus button to add additional ranges.</li>
        <li>Use the minus button to remove unwanted ranges.</li>

    <h3 id="fbd0b77-0516-21e4-d5d3-551b223748cd_Scenarios">Scenarios</h3>
    <p>The Scenarios panel allows you to specify if you wish to have revenue line item records' Best Case and/or Worst Case fields available on the forecast worksheets. The "Likely" scenario is included automatically because it matches the revenue line item record's required amount field. When "Best" and "Worst" are also selected, users will have the ability to view and modify these additional values based on their opinion of what values may come about in the sale. This provides a broader range possible sales information when working to make forecasts as predictive as possible.</p>
    <p>To add the Best or Worst scenario, click in the text box and select from the dropdown list which appears. Unwanted scenarios may be removed by clicking the "x". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e0c96860-7ac9-8abb-8903-5502ff59e99e.png" alt="" width="430" height="69" /></p>

<p>Once the Forecast Configurations have been completed, Sugar will apply the selected options and do an initial load of revenue line items to the Forecasts module. The selected Time Periods are locked at the completion of the Forecast Configuration wizard, and the Ranges are locked once the first Save Draft or Commit action is performed within the Forecasts module. If, at a later time, the selections you made for Time Periods and Ranges need to be changed, the only way this can be accomplished is at the expense of any existing Forecasting data.</p>
<p>Should you choose to <strong>lose all forecasting worksheets for the current, past, and future time periods</strong>, a user with administrator access can navigate to <span>https://yourinstancename.com/#bwc/index.php?module=Forecasts&amp;action=ResetSettings</span> (where "https://yourinstancename.com" represents the URL you use to navigate to your Sugar instance) to instantly reset the Forecasts module. Please note that you cannot undo this action, and you will not be prompted to confirm this decision before it takes effect.</p>
<p><strong>Please take caution</strong>: Navigating to the aforementioned URL will reset your Forecasts module to a state as if it had never been used before, enabling you to make fresh selections for all elements within the Forecasts Configuration by navigating to Admin &gt; Forecasts. Your instance's revenue line item records will not be affected.</p>

    <p>The Contract Types list view displays all contract type records meeting the current search criteria. You can view the basic details of each contract type within the field columns.</p>
    <p>You have the option to change what fields are displayed in list view by configuring your layout options in the Contract Types Advanced Search. For more information on configuring your list view, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/03_Search#Layout_Options">Layout Options</a> section of the Search documentation.</p>

    <p>List view displays the current search results broken into pages that you can scroll through rather than displaying potentially hundreds of rows at once. To the right just below the search panel you can see which records of the total results set are currently being displayed. The two single-arrow Next and Previous buttons can be used to scroll through the records page-by-page. The two double-arrow First Page and Last Page buttons allow you to skip to the beginning or the end of your current results.</p>
    <p>By default, Sugar displays 20 records per list view page, but administrators can change the number of records displayed via Admin &gt; System Settings. For more information on changing the number of displayed records, please refer to the <a href="#efc04ca-ebba-0f36-db59-551b22839419_fbcc0098-7ae9-b6e0-60c5-55b99e622112_User_Interface">System</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

    <h2 id="eed0c07-349e-0f03-dd79-551b22c9bbc2_Ordering_Contract_Types">Ordering Contract Types</h2>
    <p>When creating contract types, you will define the order in which the contract type is displayed in the Type dropdown field in the Contracts module. The numeric value (e.g. 1, 2, 3, etc.) you enter in the List Order field determines the order each contract type will appear on the dropdown list. For example, a contract type with a list order of "1" will be displayed at the top of the dropdown list followed by the next value (e.g. 2), and so forth. Please note that you can change the list order by editing the contract type via the <a href="#eed0c07-349e-0f03-dd79-551b22c9bbc2_Editing_Via_List_View">list view</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="eed0c07-349e-0f03-dd79-551b22c9bbc2_Deleting_Contract_Types">Deleting Contract Types</h2>
    <p>If a contract type record is invalid or should no longer appear in your organization's Sugar instance, it may be deleted from the Contract Types list view. Deleting via the list view allows you to mass delete multiple records at once. Please note that d eleting contract type records will not delete the related records (e.g. documents) and will only remove the relationship.</p>
    <h3 id="eed0c07-349e-0f03-dd79-551b22c9bbc2_Mass_Deleting_Via_List_View">Mass Deleting Via List View</h3>
    <p>Use the following steps to delete one or more contract type records via the list view:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Navigate to the Contract Types list view via Admin &gt; Contract Types.</li>

        <li>Choose "Delete" from the Actions menu.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/81ae70d7-9b17-be90-6348-55028bcf6793.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/81ae70d7-9b17-be90-6348-55028bcf6793.png" width="266" height="164" /></li>
        <li>A pop-up message will display asking for confirmation. Click "Ok" to proceed.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Due to PHP memory limitations on the server, there may be occasions when the application times out while deleting a large number of contract type records. If you encounter an error when performing this action, we recommend selecting the records in smaller batches.</p>
    <h2 id="eed0c07-349e-0f03-dd79-551b22c9bbc2_Exporting_Contract_Types">Exporting Contract Types</h2>
    <p>Sugar's Export option allows users to download all fields for the selected contract types to their computers as a .CSV (comma-separated values) file. This may be useful when needing to use Contract data with other software such as Microsoft Excel. Due to PHP memory limitations on the server, there may be occasions when the application times out while exporting a large number of contract type records. If you encounter an error when performing this action, we recommend selecting the records in smaller batches.</p>
    <p>Contract Types may be exported from the Contract Types list view by selecting "Export" from the Actions menu. Once the export is complete, a .CSV file will open up with all the Contract Type field values for the selected record(s).</p>

    <h2 id="bb9-e28b-551b22465961_Overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>Sugar's Employees module consists of individual people within your organization. The Employees module allows you to see a list of all employees, their contact information, and their employment status in one convenient location. Employee records are typically created when a user record is created, but users with administrative access can also add non-user employees. This means that, typically, all users will be listed as employees, but not all employees are necessarily Sugar users.</p>
    <p>As the Employees module contains internal information about your company, not specifically Sugar, it is not subject to <a href="#a40-f304-eea1-4447-551b22d55799_Team_Management">team</a> and <a href="#fdc0792-a630-699f-112c-551b22b26707_Role_Management">role</a> restrictions.</p>

    <h2 id="bb9-e28b-551b22465961_Employee_Fields">Employee Fields</h2>
    <p>The Employees module contains a number of stock fields which come out-of-the-box with Sugar. The below definitions are suggested meanings for the fields, but the fields can be leveraged differently to best meet your organization's needs. Fields can be altered, added, or removed via Admin &gt; Studio.

<p>There are various methods for creating employees in Sugar including via the Employees module, the Users module, and duplication. The full edit view layout opens when creating the employee directly from the Employees menu and includes all of the relevant fields for your organization's employees. The edit view layout can be configured via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on configuring layouts, please refer to the <a href="#f610ecf-f285-110a-1ef5-551b2291c5d7_Layouts">Studio</a> documentation.</p>
<h3 id="bb9-e28b-551b22465961_Creating_Via_Employees_Module">Creating Via Employees Module</h3>
<p>One of the most common methods of employee creation is via the Create Employee option in the Employees module tab. This opens up the edit view layout which allows you to enter in all the relevant information for the employee. <br />Use the following steps to create an employee via the Employees module:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Hover on the Employees module and select "Create Employee". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/f12b601a-0b20-41c7-7e57-5502ffcdbddb.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/f12b601a-0b20-41c7-7e57-5502ffcdbddb.png" width="283" height="129" /></li>

<h2 id="bb9-e28b-551b22465961_Searching_Employees">Searching Employees</h2>
<p>The Employees list view includes a Basic and Advanced Search to help you locate records easily and effectively in a module-specific manner. Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Employees list view below. Please note that Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %services). This will pull up any record that has the word "services" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p>
<p>For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/03_Search">Search</a> documentation.</p>

<p>When you run a search, Sugar will return records matching all (as opposed to any) of the fields and checkboxes for which you have given a value. For example, if you select "Active Employees" and enter an employee's name, Sugar will only return employee records with a matching name that are active. Once the search is complete, the relevant results will populate in the <a href="#bb9-e28b-551b22465961_Employees_List_View">list view</a> below the search panel. To see all employee records, simply click "Clear" and then "Search" to perform a blank search with no filters.</p>

    <h2 id="ecf0763-7e16-e69c-90e1-551b2260ade8_Tag_Tree">Tag Tree</h2>
    <p>Tags are similar to folders and enable you to categorize articles according to specific criteria, such as a topic, to make locating articles easier. When you tag an article, the system creates a link between the tag and the article which resides in the Sugar database. An article can be linked with more than one tag. Similarly, a tag can be linked with multiple articles. <br />The tag tree can be seen on the left side of the page next to the list view. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/7289fd74-8174-4a55-cc43-550302b7c1ba.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/7289fd74-8174-4a55-cc43-550302b7c1ba.png" width="250" height="224" /><br />Tags in Sugar will display in the tree structure with the count of articles in that tag next to the tag name in parentheses. For example : Basic Usage tag has four articles with that tag.</p>
    <h3 id="ecf0763-7e16-e69c-90e1-551b2260ade8_Nested_Folders">Nested Folders</h3> Tags can be parent tags or child tags. Parent tags are the top most category and child tags are nested within parent tags. Click the plus sign next to a tag name in order to expand out any children tags underneath it. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/df52bca2-8942-a1e5-e155-55030264535e.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/df52bca2-8942-a1e5-e155-55030264535e.png" width="250" height="290" /><br />You can have multiple child tags for a parent and you can nest tags for many levels. The article count for each tag only includes articles explicitly assigned to the tag and does not include any articles assigned to child tags. Notice in the screen above, Adv Troubleshooting tag has one article assigned, but the direct parent of this tag, Troubleshooting, has zero. <br />
    <h3 id="ecf0763-7e16-e69c-90e1-551b2260ade8_Checkbox_Selection">Checkbox Selection</h3>
    <p>Each tag in the tag tree has a checkbox next to the tag name. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a861a5a0-a63d-921d-eb6e-550302e07af5.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a861a5a0-a63d-921d-eb6e-550302e07af5.png" width="250" height="225" /><br />The tag checkbox is used for the Delete Tag action only. For more information on how to delete tags, please refer to the <a href="#ecf0763-7e16-e69c-90e1-551b2260ade8_Deleting_Tags">Deleting Tags</a> section in this documentation. <br /><strong>Note</strong> : Selecting a checkbox for a tag does not select the articles in that tag.

    <p>The Knowledge Base Administration list view displays all articles for the selected tag from the tag tree. You can view the basic details of each article within the field columns.</p>
    <h3 id="ecf0763-7e16-e69c-90e1-551b2260ade8_Pagination">Pagination</h3>
    <p>List view displays the current tag results broken into pages that you can scroll through rather than displaying potentially thousands of rows at once. To the right you can see which records of the total results set are currently being displayed. The two single-arrow Next and Previous buttons can be used to scroll through the records page-by-page. The two double-arrow First Page and Last Page buttons allow you to skip to the beginning or the end of your current results. <br />By default, Sugar displays 20 records per list view page, but administrators can change the number of records displayed via Admin &gt; System Settings. For more information on changing the number of displayed records, please refer to the <a href="#efc04ca-ebba-0f36-db59-551b22839419_fbcc0098-7ae9-b6e0-60c5-55b99e622112_User_Interface">System</a> documentation in the Administration guide. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5bab8f70-dc1c-2d08-585f-5503026c81e3.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5bab8f70-dc1c-2d08-585f-5503026c81e3.png" width="502" height="156" /></p>

    <p>Knowledge Base Administration allows admin users to create new tags to categorize articles by. Use the following steps to create a new tag from Knowledge Base Administration:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select "Create New Tag" from the Admin Actions menu. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/c79b7ccb-9d1f-f2e2-c770-550302ffb0a6.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/c79b7ccb-9d1f-f2e2-c770-550302ffb0a6.png" width="390" height="238" /></li>
        <li>Select the desired parent tag from the tag tree. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/4eaef747-261a-f565-f439-55030242487c.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/4eaef747-261a-f565-f439-55030242487c.png" width="357" height="231" /><br />If the new tag needs to be at the root level of the tag tree then select "Tags" at the top of the tree as the parent.</li>
        <li>Enter in a new tag name and click "Save". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/17f5e422-0b2b-592c-dee6-550302ebd078.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/17f5e422-0b2b-592c-dee6-550302ebd078.png" width="450" height="217" /></li>
        <li>The tag will then show as a child of the selected tag. The Create New Tag and parent tag remain selected. This allows you to continue to create new tags under the same tag without having to follow steps one and two again each time.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="ecf0763-7e16-e69c-90e1-551b2260ade8_Deleting_Tags">Deleting Tags</h2>
    <p>Knowledge Base Administration allows admin users to delete tags that are no longer being used. The tag being deleted must not have any articles on it and any child tags of the tag must also not have any articles, as they will be deleted as well.

    <p>Knowledge Base Administration allows admin users to move one or more articles from one tag to another. Since articles can exist in many different tags, the move will only move an article from one tag, not all tags that article is on. Use the following steps to move articles from one tag to another in Knowledge Base Administration:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select "Move Selected Articles" from the Admin Actions menu. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8db1fa4d-48fc-a369-40a6-550302c5c3d2.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8db1fa4d-48fc-a369-40a6-550302c5c3d2.png" width="390" height="215" /></li>

    <p>The Knowledge Base module in Sugar comes with a keyword searching ability that relies on the database having full-text searching enabled. Full text search is typically configured with MySQL and Oracle by default, but MSSQL requires some additional steps. <br />If using MSSQL 2005, 2008, or 2008R2 Express versions, please be sure to use the "Express with Advanced Services" version. The standard Express versions of MSSQL do not come with full-text searching at the database level. <br /><strong>Note</strong>: If you installed the standard SQL Express version, you can download the SQL Express with Advanced Services from Microsoft to install full-text Search. <br />MSSQL Standard and Enterprise levels come with full-text searching in the product but is disabled by default during the install process. Run the following query on your Sugar database to determine if full-text searching is installed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>SELECT FULLTEXTSERVICEPROPERTY('IsFullTextInstalled')</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the query above returns a "1", then full-text search is installed. If full text search is not enabled in your instance of MSSQL, but you are running Express with Advanced Services or higher versions, then you will have to modify your installation of MSSQL to include the "Full-Text Search" feature. <br /><strong>Note</strong>: For more information on installing or adding features to MSSQL, please refer to Microsoft's documentation.</p>

<p>In order to seamlessly automate business processes, Sugar's Process Author suite leverages four interconnected process-related modules. The <a href="#ea20e8f-7234-acd4-1983-551b22de680d_Process_Business_Rules">Process Business Rules</a> module and the <a href="#eb20a04-f8b9-6a0b-635d-551b2266d733_Process_Email_Templates">Process Email Templates</a> module are used to create rules and email templates that will be referenced by records created in the <a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Process_Definitions">Process Definitions</a> module. Once a process definition has been created, it will generate a record in the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/505_Processes">Processes</a> module each time the process definition is triggered.</p>
<p>The Process Business Rules, Process Email Templates, and Process Definitions modules can be viewed and configured by any system administrator user. In addition, regular users with a role that provides developer access to one or more modules will be able to access all Process Author functions for those modules. Regular users without developer role permissions will only have access to the Processes module. For more information about roles, please review the <a href="#fdc0792-a630-699f-112c-551b22b26707_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation.</p>
<p>The following image illustrates the relationship between the Process Author modules:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/eeee68ca-d305-6eb3-6222-550302806231.png" alt="" width="445" height="334" /></p>

            <td>
                <p>A process definition defines the steps in an overall business process. Process definitions are created by a Sugar administrator. The process definition consists of a network of activities and their relationships, criteria to indicate the start and end of the process, and information about the individual activities (e.g., participants) contained within the business process.</p>

            <td>
                <p>A process is a running instance of a process definition. A single process begins every time a process definition is executed. For example, a single process definition could be created to automate quote approvals, but because users may engage in several quote approvals per day, each approval will be represented by a separate process instance, all governed by the single process definition. In other words, the Processes module is the many-to-one (M:1) child module of Process Definitions.</p>
                <p>The Processes module is the only Process Author module that is visible to regular users. From the Processes dashlet and module list view, they will be able to see running processes if there is anything for them to approve, reject, or review.</p>
                <p>There are three ways an administrator can view a list of processes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span><b>Processes module list view :</b> List views for the Processes module d</span>isplay processes that require the logged-in user to take approve, reject, or review action. Admin users, like regular users, will only see the processes that are waiting for them. List views can be accessed by navigating to Processes &gt; View Processes.</li>
                    <li><strong><a href="#e850d25-94e3-38db-da11-551b22b61fca_Processes_Dashlet">Processes dashlet</a> : </strong><span>This dashlet d</span>isplays processes that require the logged-in user to take approve, reject, or review action.

From the Process Management page, the admin can also </span>monitor process status, reassign or cancel an in-progress process, or repair processes in an error state. The Process Management page is accessible via the Admin &gt; Process Author panel or via the Processes module tab by clicking on "Process Management".</li>

            <td>
                <p>A process business rule is a reusable set of conditions and outcomes that can be embedded in a process definition. The set of rules may enforce business policy, make a decision, or infer new data from existing data. For example, if Sally manages all business opportunities of $10,000 or more, and Chris manages all business opportunities under $10,000, a process business rule can be created and used by all relevant process definitions to ensure that the assignment policy is respected. In the case of an eventual personnel change, only the process business rule will need to be edited to affect all related processes.</p>

                <p>A process email template is required in order to include a Send Message event in a process definition.

<p>For processes, the admin user is restricted to the same access as a regular user in the Processes module. This means that in Processes list view and the Processes dashlet, the admin user will not see processes unless they have participated in that process or they are expected to participate in it.</p>
<p>The exhaustive list of open and completed processes is accessible only via the admin's Process Management page. This page can be accessed from two places in Sugar:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Admin &gt; Process Author &gt; Process Management:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/3a94f447-211a-498e-59d0-5515efe9584a.png" alt="" width="500" height="149" /></li>

<ul>
    <li><strong>History</strong> : The History option appears in the record's Actions menu and provides a historical summary of the process's lifecycle.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/99ac5ef4-0ae1-5349-cedc-5515ef6223aa.png" alt="" width="390" height="178" /><br />Click on "History" to launch the Process History window:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b4a8d987-1712-e14e-aed3-556dcd964bab.png" alt="history-popup" width="600" height="260" /></li>
    <li><strong>Select New Process User</strong> : The Select New Process User option appears in the record's Actions menu and will display all of the process users who have engaged with the process, and will allow the administrator to select a new process user to execute the current activity.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/c7030da5-19b2-cf66-b47a-5543b33ad5c6.png" alt="list-select-proc-user" width="523" height="213" /><br />To reassign the process, choose "Select New Process User" from the Actions menu.

</ul>
<h3 id="e850d25-94e3-38db-da11-551b22b61fca_Searching_Processes">Searching Processes</h3>
<p>The Process Management list view includes a module search to help you locate running, completed, and incomplete processes easily and effectively. Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the list view below.</p>
<p>Unlike the standard Sugar module search bar filter, the Process Management search bar will query all Process fields by default. This means that a search for "error" will return processes named "Approve Error Resolution" and processes that affect a record named "Customer receives error when logging in" and even processes that are in an "Error" status. </p>
<p>Please note that on the Process Management page, Sugar automatically assumes a wildcard character (%) at both the beginning and the end of your search phrase. Therefore, the search for "error" will pull up any record that has the word "error" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e5550c9a-4253-23a6-6a4a-550302acdc4c.png" alt="" width="695" height="169" /></p>
<p>The search also provides a Filter option which can be used in combination with the open Search box to narrow your search further using the available options as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>All</strong> : Returns all processes.</li>
    <li><strong>Processes Completed</strong> : Returns only processes with a status of "Completed".</li>
    <li><strong>Processes Terminated</strong> : Returns only processes with a status of "Terminated".</li>
    <li><strong>Processes In Progress</strong> : Returns only processes with a status of "In Progress".</li>
    <li><strong>Processes Cancelled</strong> : Returns only processes with a status of "Cancelled".</li>
    <li><strong>Processes Error</strong> : Returns only processes with a status of "Error".</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/611e08f0-4da1-4a43-bef9-5543b884705f.png" alt="process-list-filters" width="650" height="210" /></p>
<p>When you choose a filter, Sugar will return processes which match both the selected filter and any name provided in the "Search..." bar in the filtered list view results. For example, if you select "Processes Completed" in the Filter options and enter a search query, Sugar will only return processes that contain a match to the search query and have a Completed status. To see all processes, simply select "All" in the filter and remove any text from the search bar. You can also click the X that appears within the search bar. When you run a search using a saved filter, the search will not be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the Process Management page will automatically display all unfiltered results. </p>
<h2 id="e850d25-94e3-38db-da11-551b22b61fca_Unattended_Processes">Unattended Processes</h2>
<p>An unattended process is a running process instance that has been interrupted because an activity is dependent upon the response of an inactive user. If an activity is encountered within a process, and the activity's process user record's status is "Inactive" or its employee status is "Not Active", the process will be considered unattended. The activity cannot be completed unless the administrator designates a new process user.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: While an unattended process will also appear in the <a href="#e850d25-94e3-38db-da11-551b22b61fca_Process_Management_List_View">Process Management</a> list, its status will remain "In Progress" and will not indicate that it is in an unattended state.</p>
<p>The list of unattended processes is accessible via the admin's Unattended Processes page. This page can only be accessed from the Processes module tab's actions menu:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/4ff5e2d1-f0b8-336a-a23a-5543f94b4322.png" alt="unattended-menu" width="184" height="122" /></p>
<p>To select a new process user for an unattended process, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>From the Unattended Processes list view, expand the actions menu for the row that contains the unattended process.</li>
    <li>Click on "Select New Process User".<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b9715b86-4872-fcc0-45fe-5543fe9fc695.png" alt="unattended-select" width="485" height="155" /></li>
    <li>After a brief pause, the Select New Process User drawer will appear.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a0c0362f-8d82-9d50-7c70-5543fe247655.png" alt="unatteneded-drawer" width="482" height="162" /></li>
    <li>Find and select the name of the new process user and then click Done.</li>
</ol>
<p>The updated process should no longer be visible in the Unattended Processes list, and the new process user will see the activity in their Processes dashlet and list view.</p>
<h2 id="e850d25-94e3-38db-da11-551b22b61fca_Terminated_vs_Cancelled_Processes">Terminated vs. Cancelled Processes</h2>
<p>Process Author automatically terminates a process when the record related to the process' Start event is deleted. The associated process will be removed from the Processes dashlet and the process record will display "Terminated" in the Status column of the Process Management list view. Processes may also be terminated as a result of meeting conditions specified in the Process Termination settings. For more information, please refer to the <a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Configuring_Process_Termination_Settings">Configuring Process Termination Settings</a> section of the Process Definition documentation.</p>
<p>Cancelled processes, on the other hand, have been intentionally stopped by the administrator. The associated process will be removed from the Processes dashlet and the process record will display "Cancelled" in the Status column of the Process Management list view.</p>
<h2 id="e850d25-94e3-38db-da11-551b22b61fca_Importing_and_Exporting_Process_Author_Module_Records">Importing and Exporting Process Author Module Records</h2>
<p>Sugar's Process Author supports import/export functionality for records in all modules except the Processes module, which only contains running instances of process definitions. To import records into the Process Definitions, Process Email Templates, or Process Business Rules modules, the import file must be formatted as the appropriate proprietary file type, as shown in the table below. All exported records will download as the corresponding file type.</p>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Process Author Module</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Supported File Extension</strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Process Definitions</td>
            <td>.bpm</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Process Email Templates</td>
            <td>.pet</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Process Business Rules</td>
            <td>.pbr</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>Due to the proprietary nature of these file types, only files that have been exported from a Sugar instance can be imported into a Sugar instance. For example, an administrator may choose to design process definitions in a sandbox or development instance before moving them to a production environment. For this, the files would be exported from the dev instance as .bpm files and then imported into the production instance's Process Definitions module. </p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Process Definitions may contain references to Business Rules and Email Templates. These references are lost when the Process Definition is imported. Even if the Business Rules and Email Templates are imported prior to importing the Process Definition, the references are not automatically reestablished in the imported Process Definition. They must be reestablished manually.</p>
<p>Process Author module records can be exported from any of the following locations:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The individual module record's list view Actions menu:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/cda37490-4fab-3a46-34ab-550302336242.png" alt="" width="319" height="194" /></li>

<p>The log level is set to Critical, which is equivalent to Sugar's Fatal log level, and starts recording events as soon as Process Author has been installed. A developer can update the system config.php to change Process Author settings including "logger_level", "error_number_of_cycles", and "error_timeout". Changes that are made to config.php are honored in real time.</p>
<h2 id="e850d25-94e3-38db-da11-551b22b61fca_Process_Author_Scheduler">Process Author Scheduler</h2>
<p>Schedulers in Sugar automate the execution of system processes. Schedulers are available only to administrative users and can be accessed by navigating to Admin &gt; Schedulers. Process Author Scheduled Job is responsible for processes associated with Process Author. It is active and runs as often as possible by default. The Process Author Scheduled Job will check for any active time-based process events in a pending state. If any processes meet this criterion, the scheduler will ensure the process flow continues.</p>
<p>For more information about Sugar schedulers, please refer to the <a href="#f2906be-c8c9-5eea-7952-551b229a6790_Schedulers">System &gt; Schedulers</a> section of the Administration Guide. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Process events processed by this scheduler will be run by the admin user (user id = '1') in Process History unless the admin user is disabled.</p>

<p>The following image illustrates the relationship between all of the Process Author modules:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/84d7932c-7939-cdb5-c636-5503029ebe28.png" alt="" width="408" height="305" /></p>
<h2 id="ea20e8f-7234-acd4-1983-551b22de680d_Use_Case">Use Case</h2>
<p>Sally responds to all sales leads who inquire via email, while Chris handles the leads acquired via cold calling. The Sugar administrator at their company has created a process business rule to enforce this lead-assignment policy. When the administrator wants to automate business processes related to leads, she can embed the business rule in one or all of those process definitions. If Chris or Sally eventually leaves the company and a new salesperson is hired, only the process business rule will need to be edited to affect all related process definitions and their running processes.</p>
<h2 id="ea20e8f-7234-acd4-1983-551b22de680d_Creating_a_Process_Business_Rule_Record">Creating a Process Business Rule Record</h2>
<p>You should typically create business rules before creating any process definitions that will use the rules. However, it is possible to save an incomplete process definition in order to navigate away and build a rule, then return later to complete the process definition.</p>
<p>Process business rules can be created from any of the following places in Sugar:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Process Business Rules dashlet:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/27de0ded-c59a-4209-0a06-550302842661.png" alt="" width="561" height="131" /></li>
    <li>Process Business Rules module tab menu:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/403d5b23-2335-6baa-02fd-55030216478a.png" alt="" width="248" height="161" /></li>
    <li>Process Business Rules list view:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/90730df7-7b13-3180-654f-5503023d4047.png" alt="" width="417" height="178" /></li>
</ul>
<p>Upon clicking "Create Process Business Rule" (or the Create button from list view), you will be directed to the record view. The record view is where you store information that will make it easy to find and understand the rule in the future. After completing this form, you will then be directed to the <a href="#ea20e8f-7234-acd4-1983-551b22de680d_Designing_a_Process_Business_Rule_in_the_Rules_Builder">Rules Builder</a> interface where the actual rule criteria and outcomes are defined.</p>
<p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/490d409d-3247-c436-6e2a-550302c6a90c.png" alt="" width="425" height="175" /></p>
<p>The record view's available fields are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Name</strong> : (required) Give the rule or rule set a unique and descriptive name. Clear, descriptive, and unique record names will be important in order to search for and reuse business rules across multiple Process Definitions.</li>
    <li><strong>Target Module</strong> : (required) Select the module that will be evaluated by the Process Business Rule.</li>
    <li><strong>Description</strong> : Type an explanation of the Process Business Rule in this field.</li>
    <li><strong>Save and Design</strong> : Saves the record and redirects to the Rules Builder page.</li>
    <li><strong>Business Rule Type </strong>: There is currently only one rule type enabled for Process Author. There is no need to edit this field.</li>
</ul>
<p>After configuring and saving the Process Business Rule it will automatically appear on the administrator's Process Business Rules dashlet and list view, but it will not be ready to use in a Process Definition until the design step has been completed via the Rules Builder. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d4313c09-2fef-4114-cf8a-550302f3236d.png" alt="" width="271" height="228" /></p>
<h2 id="ea20e8f-7234-acd4-1983-551b22de680d_Designing_a_Process_Business_Rule_in_the_Rules_Builder">Designing a Process Business Rule in the Rules Builder</h2>
<p>After saving the process business rule record, define the conditions and conclusions that the rule will evaluate and execute using the Rules Builder table.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>The Rules Builder interface may not be compatible with some touch-screen mobile devices. Please interact with the Rules Builder from a desktop or laptop computer to prevent any potential complications.</p>
<h3 id="ea20e8f-7234-acd4-1983-551b22de680d_Condition_and_Conclusion_Elements">Condition and Conclusion Elements</h3>
<p>Process business rules are comprised of at least one condition:conclusion element.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Conditions</strong> : One or more "if" statements that will be evaluated as true or false.</li>
    <li><strong>Conclusions</strong> : The results that are returned if the condition evaluates to true.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, a true condition must result in a Return value. The Return value can be constructed using variables, constants, operators and/or literal values. If there are to be multiple outcomes to the condition, the Return value must be specified as the first conclusion in the business rule. For example, to change the value of a given field when the condition is true, set an arbitrary return value and then click on the + button adjacent to the table header "Conclusions" to add another conclusion column to the row where the field update can be defined.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/beccda1d-5e16-54f1-254d-55030262aa7e.png" alt="" width="352" height="176" /></p>
<p>The condition will evaluate a set of given variables and if the condition is evaluated as "true", the conclusion will then return a specified value. In the following example, an Opportunity with a probability of 90% or more will return the character string, "Hot Deal".<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/65906c5f-8ab0-eaf9-7efd-5503028e002f.png" alt="" width="353" height="109" /></p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Process business rule "Return Values" will always convert to text for evaluation within a process definition.</p>
<h3 id="ea20e8f-7234-acd4-1983-551b22de680d_Operators">Operators</h3>
<p>Conditions utilize comparison operators. Multiple conditions in a single row will be combined using AND logic, requiring all conditions in a row to be satisfied in order for the statement to be evaluated as true. The available operators are:</p>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Operator</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Definition</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Available for Field Types</strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>==</td>
            <td>is equal to</td>
            <td>text, currency, integer, date, dropdown, multiselect</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&gt;=</td>
            <td>is greater than or equal to</td>
            <td>integer, currency, date</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;=</td>
            <td>is less than or equal to</td>
            <td>integer, currency, date</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&gt;</td>
            <td>is greater than</td>
            <td>integer, currency, date</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;</td>
            <td>is less than</td>
            <td>integer, currency, date</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>!=</td>
            <td>is not equal to</td>
            <td>text, integer, currency, date, dropdown, multiselect</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If using a currency field in a business rule, values should have no currency symbol (such as $) and no thousands separator. Only the period (.) is allowed as a decimal separator.</p>
<h3 id="ea20e8f-7234-acd4-1983-551b22de680d_Rule_Sets">Rule Sets</h3>
<p>A single process business rule record could potentially define a set of several rules, or a rule set. In the following example of a set of rules for routing leads, each row of the Rules Builder table represents a separate rule that will be evaluated by the process. Each row is evaluated independently in descending order. When a rule in the rule set is evaluated as true, the evaluation process stops. Therefore, only the conclusions defined by the first (topmost) true condition will be returned.</p>
<p>The following example represents a rule set that evaluates the fields "Lead Score" and "Lead Source" to determine a return value and assigned user. The first row translates conversationally to: If the lead's score is greater than or equal to 50, and the lead's source is a Cold Call, then capture the office phone number and assign the lead to Chris Olliver.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a9623201-2e21-3584-629f-55030215dc5f.png" alt="" width="537" height="186" /></p>

<p>Process Email Templates can be customized using data pulled directly from your Sugar database. For example, an email template triggered from the Cases module could contain critical case details such as the support agent's name or the phone number of the contact related to the case.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Related-module variables will only be available from modules that have a one-to-many relationship with the target module. For example, where the template's target module is Opportunities:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>1:M &gt;&gt; Account:Opportunities</strong> : The Accounts module will be available as a related module in the Fields Selector.</li>
    <li><strong>M:M &gt;&gt; Contacts:Opportunities</strong> : The Contacts module will not be available as a related module in the Fields Selector.</li>
    <li><strong>M:1 &gt;&gt; Quotes:Opportunities</strong> : The Quotes module will not be available as a related module in the Fields Selector. </li>
</ul>
<p>A common use case for the Field Selector tool is using the recipient's name in the message body (e.g., "Dear {first_name} {last_name},"). To insert a custom name using the Field Selector tool, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>From the Process Email Template's design view, place the cursor in the message body where the custom variable should appear. Click on the Field Selector icon in the design toolbar.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/61a38718-d2f8-c327-fd5e-55030263aa44.png" alt="" width="640" height="154" /></li>
    <li>The Fields Selector drawer will open over the current screen. By default, the Field Selector will display all fields in the template's target module (in this example, Opportunities). <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d9eb6eec-5632-bb04-ee2a-55030265ab67.png" alt="" width="526" height="316" /></li>
    <li>To find a variable from a related module, click the word "Module" to the left of the search bar and select the desired module. The list of field variables will update automatically. Select the checkbox adjacent to the field or fields that you would like to insert into the email template and then click "Done". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/28774317-3d42-4829-9c31-55030227110c.png" alt="" width="560" height="218" /></li>
    <li>The template's design view will once again be visible and the selected variables will appear where your cursor was positioned before clicking on the Field Selector icon. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/914a3c3a-7ee9-4f64-ef85-5503028db67a.png" alt="" width="647" height="71" /></li>
    <li>If necessary, use the text editor to move the variables or insert additional characters. In this example, we will move the first name variable {::lead_direct_reports::first_name::} into position before the last name variable, and insert a space character in between the two variables:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/55f1acf0-75a6-d6f3-434f-550302df0abb.png" alt="" width="429" height="28" /></li>

<h2 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The Process Definitions module is one of the four modules that make up the <a href="#e850d25-94e3-38db-da11-551b22b61fca_Process_Author">Process Author</a> business process management tool in Sugar . Process definitions are central to the Process Author suite. They define the steps in automated business processes and control the flow of work that is allocated during running processes in Sugar. Process definitions are created by a Sugar administrator and consist of a network of activities and their relationships, criteria to indicate the start and end of the process, and information about the individual activities (e.g., participants) contained within the business process.</p>
<p>Before continuing, please read the <a href="#e850d25-94e3-38db-da11-551b22b61fca_Process_Author">Process Author</a> overview page, which defines critical vocabulary and other elements that may be referenced on this page.</p>
<p>This documentation contains the following pages:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#e850d25-94e3-38db-da11-551b22b61fca_Process_Author">Process Author</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Additionally, the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/505_Processes">Processes</a> page of the Application Guide contains documentation for the user-facing elements of Process Author. Please note that Process Author is exclusive to Enterprise and Ultimate editions of Sugar 7.6.x and later.</p>
<p>The following image illustrates the relationship between all of the Process Author modules:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/eeee68ca-d305-6eb3-6222-550302806231.png" alt="" width="419" height="314" /></p>
<p>The process definition will be the parent record for countless running processes in Sugar. Every time a process definition's <a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Adding_a_Start_Event"> Start event</a> is triggered, a single process will begin to run in Sugar. When a running process requires action from a user, that user will see the process in their <a href="#e850d25-94e3-38db-da11-551b22b61fca_Processes_Dashlet">Processes dashlet</a> and Processes module list view. Users will never see the parent process definition that controls the process, nor will they see any processes for which they are not required to act.</p>
<p>This is an example of a complete process definition created in the <a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Designing_a_Process_Definition_in_the_Visual_Designer">Visual Designer</a>:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/69ed1415-8b6a-a177-4e04-5503027db84b.png" alt="" width="584" height="156" /></p>
<p>In the example above, the Start event is triggered when a $10,000+ opportunity moves to stage "Quotation" from any other stage. Every time this condition is met, the process definition will generate a new process instance.</p>
<h2 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>If a process definition will utilize <a href="#ea20e8f-7234-acd4-1983-551b22de680d_Process_Business_Rules">process business rules</a> or <a href="#eb20a04-f8b9-6a0b-635d-551b2266d733_Process_Email_Templates">process email templates</a>, those records must be created before designing the process definition. For more information about creating records in these supporting Process Author modules, please refer to the corresponding section of the Process Author documentation.</p>
<h2 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Creating_a_New_Process_Definition_Record">Creating a New Process Definition Record</h2>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>All process definitions are disabled by default so that they will not trigger during the design phase. Please refer to the <a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Enabling_Process_Definitions">Enabling Process Definitions</a> section of this page for steps to enable a process definition.</p>
<p>Process Definitions can be created from any of the following places in Sugar:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Process Definitions dashlet:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/2157a472-7e92-3af4-4d61-5503028ea05f.png" alt="" width="430" height="131" /></li>
    <li>Process Definitions module tab menu:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/dda36e9b-19d8-0d7d-aaac-55030203996d.png" alt="" width="227" height="155" /></li>
    <li>Process Definitions list view:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/ae6b0eb3-4e1e-c14c-6137-55030203491e.png" alt="" width="429" height="182" /></li>
</ul>
<p>Upon clicking "Create Process Definitions" (or the Create button from list view), you will be directed to the process definition's record view. The record view is where you store information that will make it easy to find and understand the process definition in the future. After completing this form, you will then be directed to the <a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Designing_a_Process_Definition_in_the_Visual_Designer">Visual Designer</a> canvas where the process definition's elements can be composed.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8fb08b7a-cac9-4030-f89c-5503023c877c.png" alt="" width="523" height="316" /></p>
<p>The record view's available fields are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Name</strong> : (required) Give the process definition a unique and descriptive name. Easy-to-understand record names will be important in order to search for process definitions later.</li>
    <li><strong>Target Module</strong> : (required) The target module is the module that will be used for the Start event in the process definition design. The module chosen here will also determine which related modules are available in the design view.</li>
    <li><strong>Assigned to</strong> : This field is not associated with any work events in the process definition. The assigned user should be set to the logged-in administrator user who is creating the process definition.<br /><strong>Description</strong> : Type an explanation of the process definition's behavior and purpose in this field. The contents of the Description field will be visible via the Processes and Process Definitions dashlets.</li>
    <li><strong>Save &amp; Design</strong> : Saves the record before proceeding to the Visual Designer canvas.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>New process definitions are set to "Disabled" by default. After the design has been fully configured in the Visual Designer, you must set the process definition to "Enabled" in order for it to run.</p>
<h2 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Designing_a_Process_Definition_in_the_Visual_Designer">Designing a Process Definition in the Visual Designer</h2>
<p>Creating a process definition for your business process is easy using Process Author's visual designer, where you can graphically assemble a series of flow elements using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. In the visual designer, process definitions are auto-saved every 15 seconds, and the Undo button can revert changes as far as 25 levels back per session.</p>
<p>All process definitions are set to "Disabled" by default in order to prevent triggering of processes before the design is complete. This means that you must change the status to "Enabled" before it will work. Please see <a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Enabling_Process_Definitions">Enabling Process Definitions</a> for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>The visual designer interface may not be compatible with some touch-screen mobile devices. Please build process definitions from a desktop or laptop computer to prevent any potential complications.</p>
<h3 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Adding_a_Start_Event">Adding a Start Event</h3>
<p>A Start event indicates where a process will begin. It defines the action that will trigger a new process to run. The Start event will always be characterized by a module record in Sugar, but will vary by whether it applies to newly created records or updated records. It is possible for a single process definition to have multiple Start events, for example, one Start event triggered by updated records and a second Start event triggered by created records. All Start events in a process definition should eventually merge into a single flow.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>The target module chosen in the process definition's record view is the module that is used for the Start event in the process definition design.</p>
<p>Start events are represented by the Sugar cube icon, the first icon on the design toolbar.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/337869dd-d74b-4cce-7fd8-55771e3151b5.png" alt="start-toolbar" width="607" height="190" /></p>
<p>Follow these steps to add a Start event to the process definition:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Drag the Start event icon onto the Designer canvas.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/9a0344b1-0450-eb28-fcd8-557720f120cc.png" alt="drag-new-start" width="266" height="206" /></li>
    <li>Double-click the Start event icon's label to re-name it.<br /><strong><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/1e5c3729-fda7-9719-250f-557724e494c5.png" alt="rename-start" width="270" height="78" /><br />Note</strong>: The Start event will have an error alert (!) icon warning you to add an outgoing sequence flow element. This is normal and will disappear after you create the next element and connect it to the Start event. Fo more information about element errors, refer to the <a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Resolving_Errors_in_the_Element_Errors_Panel">Resolving Errors in the Element Errors Panel</a> section of this page.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/4bf003f5-1916-9a18-3f1e-55030219ab13.png" alt="" width="531" height="167" /></li>
    <li>To configure the Start event, right click on the Start event icon and choose "Settings".<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8b4d90ea-4c1f-380c-ec99-557724ad22ff.png" alt="start-settings" width="222" height="136" /></li>
    <li>Select an "Applies to" preference. Click on the down arrow to select how the process definition will be triggered to start. There are three options:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/73079170-692f-d395-64c6-5542383f1c2b.png" alt="new-or-updated" width="350" height="78" /><br />
        <ul>
            <li><strong>New Records Only </strong>: A new process will begin if a record is created and the specified conditions are met on the first save.</li>
            <li><strong>Updated Records Only (First Update) </strong>: A new process will begin the first time the specified conditions are met on an existing record, even if the record has been updated several times before it qualifies. Once a record meets the conditions to trigger a First Update process, it cannot trigger that process definition again. </li>
            <li><strong>Updated Records Only (All Updates) </strong>: A new process will begin every time an existing record is saved and the specified conditions are met, as long as the process is not already running against the record. A given process definition can only run one process instance against a particular record at a time. However, it is important to note that two or more different process definitions may simultaneously run against the same record.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Click inside the Criteria field to expose the criteria builder and set the conditions for the Start event. Please refer to the <a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Creating_Conditions_for_Events_and_Actions">Creating Conditions for Events and Actions</a> section of this page to configure the conditions for the Start event.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>To apply a process to both new records and updated records, create two separate Start events where one applies to new records and one applies to all updates. Join these two start events to the next element in the process definition with separate connectors.</p>
<h3 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Adding_Intermediate_Events">Adding Intermediate Events</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, intermediate events occur after a process starts but before the process is complete. Intermediate events that are placed within the overall process flow represent things that happen during the normal operation of the process such as sending messages, receiving messages, or mandatory waiting periods.</p>
<p>Intermediate events are represented by the second group of icons on the design toolbar. There are three icons that each enable a configurable event.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/266f5a35-706a-fdee-1a62-5579a0f30714.png" alt="toolbar-new-intermediate" width="600" height="179" /></p>
<p>The types of intermediate events are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Wait_Events">Wait Events</a></li>
    <li><a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Receive_Message_Events">Receive Message Events</a></li>
    <li><a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Send_Message_Events">Send Message Events</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Wait_Events">Wait Events</h4>
<p>This element will stop the execution of a process by the time interval set in the configuration. Wait events support specified times as well as a calculated delta between two times or events.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>If a Wait event is not properly configured, the flow will be halted indefinitely, thereby stopping the flow of the process.</p>
<p>To add a Wait event to the flow, drag and drop the clock icon onto the canvas:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b408afd7-b516-7314-0823-5503022a12de.png" alt="" width="204" height="189" /></p>
<p>To configure this event, right click on the icon and choose "Settings". A new window will display:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e20442d4-4298-ce59-8c7e-550302b60a1f.png" width="365" height="298" alt="e20442d4-4298-ce59-8c7e-550302b60a1f.png" /><br />The configuration window has two main options: Duration and Fixed Date. Choose one of these options to enable its configuration fields.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Duration</strong> (radio button) : Choose this option to define the duration of the Wait event.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/162b7b2d-4ec9-482f-52bb-550302f4b9f2.png" width="260" height="106" alt="162b7b2d-4ec9-482f-52bb-550302f4b9f2.png" /><br />
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Duration</strong> (text field) : Required field when "Duration" is selected above. Enter an integer to use in conjunction with the Unit field.</li>
            <li><strong>Unit</strong> : The duration will be defined in days, hours or minutes.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Fixed Dates </strong>(radio button) : Choose this option if the Wait event will be based on one or more of the record's date fields or a calculated formula. Formulas may be constructed using a combination of operators, Sugar variables, and constants.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/4ddff4b7-a02e-dc81-f144-550302ec8cff.png" width="325" height="194" alt="4ddff4b7-a02e-dc81-f144-550302ec8cff.png" /><br />
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Criteria</strong> : Click inside this field to reveal the criteria builder. Please refer to the <a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Creating_Conditions_for_Events_and_Actions">Creating Conditions for Events and Actions</a> section of this page for instructions on using the criteria builder.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>A Wait event's clock begins when the Wait event is triggered. For example, the following process definition contains three Wait events. Each one will pause and evaluate a running process at 5-minute intervals, for an aggregate 15 minutes of wait time across the process definition. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/c88d093f-dc08-b043-70b0-559c53bbc41e.png" alt="waitevent2" width="700" /></p>
<p>While the Wait events enforce an evaluation at 5, 10, and 15 minutes into the process, the settings for each element need only account for the 5-minute span between timed events, and not its relative distance from the start of the process. Therefore, the Duration setting for each Wait event in this example should be set to 5 minutes. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/27ff0560-163a-ad35-dbf8-559f025831df.png" alt="5-min" width="405" /></p>
<h4 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Receive_Message_Events">Receive Message Events</h4>
<p>This event will stop the flow of a process definition until the established criteria in the configuration is accomplished. In essence, it is a Wait event that pauses until a condition is met instead of for a specified duration.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If this event is not properly configured, it will stop the flow of the process.</p>
<p>To add a Receive Message event to the flow, drag and drop the Receive Message icon onto the canvas:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/7c98085e-2251-e427-7c13-5503024a63fd.png" alt="" width="200" height="183" /></p>
<p>To configure this event, right click on the icon and choose "Settings". A criteria builder window will display:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b3b9f5ff-6f55-b9fc-c274-5503026b80ac.png" alt="" width="299" height="159" /></p>
<p>Click inside the Criteria field to reveal the criteria builder. Please refer to the <a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Creating_Conditions_for_Events_and_Actions">Creating Conditions for Events and Actions</a> section of this page for further instructions.</p>
<h4 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Send_Message_Events">Send Message Events</h4>
<p>This event is the only one that can send email messages. These messages must be created in the <a href="#eb20a04-f8b9-6a0b-635d-551b2266d733_Process_Email_Templates">Process Email Templates</a> module. Conveniently, email recipients can be configured using variables and wildcards.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If this event is not properly configured, it does not send any mail and the flow will ignore the event and continue running.</p>
<p>To add a Send Message event to the flow, drag and drop the envelope icon onto the canvas:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e26da9ec-47eb-d12d-0ef6-5503028de420.png" alt="" width="201" height="175" /></p>

<h3 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Adding_Form_Activities">Adding Form Activities</h3>
<p>The only unit of work that requires user interaction (opposed to automation) is an Activity. It is a moment within a flow where a user must decide if a circumstance is approved or rejected, or review a record that has been routed to them. Activities are represented by the solid square icon on the design toolbar:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/7ad5444a-5e06-c84a-0f30-55774c2342d7.png" alt="toolbar-new-activity" width="621" height="178" /></p>
<p>Activities pause a process until a user makes a decision to either approve or reject the record, or indicates that they have reviewed a record that has been routed to them. When a process reaches this point in the flow, the appropriate user will see a line item in their Processes dashlet or Processes module list view. An Activity form element is configured in two steps. First, configure the <a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Forms_Setting">Forms</a> setting and then configure the <a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Users_Setting">Users</a> setting.</p>
<p>To add a form Activity to the process definition's flow, drag and drop the Activity icon onto the canvas:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/ec4ef90c-221e-932d-3b20-550302a80af1.png" alt="" width="117" height="147" /></p>
<h4 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Forms_Setting">Forms Setting</h4>
<p>The "Forms..." setting controls what type of form the process user will see when they are asked to execute this activity. The process user must be separately configured in the "<a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Users_Setting">Users...</a>" setting. There are two types of Activity form:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Approve/Reject</strong> : This type of form will present itself as an Approve button and a Reject button on the record view of the record that triggered the process. A Gateway element must be placed after the Approve/Reject activity in order to specify a flow for approval as well as a flow for rejection.</li>
    <li><strong>Route</strong> : This type of form should be used to ensure that a record within a process has been viewed or edited by the user configured in the Activity's "<a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Users_Setting">Users...</a>" setting. The form will present itself as a Route button on the record view of the record that triggered the process. The process user has the option to edit the record before clicking the Route button. The administrator may choose to ensure only relevant fields are edited by leveraging the <a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Read-Only_Fields_Tab">Read Only Fields</a> and <a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Required_Fields_Tab">Required Fields</a> options for this activity. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>If an activity is not properly configured, it will default to an Approve/Reject form.</p>
<p>To configure the Forms setting for an activity, right click on the icon and select "Forms...".</p>
<p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e84e8d8a-09dc-b45d-2006-550302792b33.png" alt="" width="191" height="137" /></p>
<p>A configuration window will open. The configuration window has four tabbed sections.</p>

<p>These are explained in detail in the following sections.</p>
<h5 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_General_Tab">General Tab</h5>
<p>View the General tab (enabled by default) to choose a form type for the activity. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/47d7abc9-8cbd-183d-c7a1-5542bda319f8.png" alt="routing-options-med" width="359" height="232" /></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Form Buttons </strong>: Select the type of form to display.</li>
    <li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Route</strong> : The user will be prompted to acknowledge that they have reviewed and optionally edited/commented on the record.</li>
            <li><strong>Approve/Reject</strong> (default) : The user will be prompted to approve or reject a circumstance. Approve/Reject form activities should always be followed by a <a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Adding_Gateway_Elements">Gateway element</a> with <a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Form_Response_Evaluations">Form Response Evaluation</a> criteria to define the next step of the process in the case of approval or rejection. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/27670f18-6c4a-a3f0-2655-554b76b750af.png" alt="form-gateway" width="331" height="123" /></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Other Routing Options</strong>: During a form activity's execution, the process user may be given the option to reassign the record associated with the process.<strong></strong>It may be appropriate to create specialized teams for users who will be engaged in particular parts of a process. For more information about managing teams and users, see the <a href="#a40-f304-eea1-4447-551b22d55799_Team_Management">Team Management</a> and <a href="#ec10f00-236f-9c84-9827-551b22807391_User_Management">User Management</a> sections of the Administration Guide.</li>
    <li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Change Assigned To User </strong>: Enabling this option will add the "Change Assigned To User" option to the actions menu of the process execution screen, as seen here:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/24d0fe44-8f72-2db5-4758-5515ef6838ac.png" alt="" width="174" height="160" /><br />When the process activity is executed, the process user must select this option if they want to change the Sugar record's Assigned To user. The process user can only assign a user from the team configured by admin in the team field under "Other Routing Options". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a6d489c6-f3b3-5389-e063-5542c213ab09.png" alt="change-assign-user" width="279" height="74" /></li>
            <li><strong>Select New Process User </strong>: Enabling this option will add the "Select New Process User" option to the actions menu of the process execution screen, allowing the designated process user to delegate the form activity to someone else. The process user can only select a new user from the team configured by admin in the Team field under "Other Routing Options". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/af9f9844-485d-6df3-91ee-5542bf744872.png" alt="new-proc-user-sm" width="173" height="181" /><br />The current process user may select a new process user from the team configured by admin in the "Other Routing Options" Team field.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/c45bc393-1cd9-9173-04f5-5542c2ecd423.png" alt="change-proc-user" width="286" height="64" /></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h5 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Read-Only_Fields_Tab">Read-Only Fields Tab</h5>
<p>Here, the administrator can restrict the process user from editing some or all fields on the Sugar record for which the process applies. Place a checkmark next to the fields that should not be edited during the form processing step.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/47268a45-2423-81ed-0d96-5503025e8696.png" alt="" width="311" height="201" /></p>
<h5 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Required_Fields_Tab">Required Fields Tab</h5>
<p>In this tab, the administrator can require the process user to complete some or all fields on the Sugar record for which the process applies. Place a checkmark next to the fields that must be populated during the form processing step.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/cc7a9fd4-6b80-1756-38da-550302ed5661.png" alt="" width="321" height="207" /></p>
<h5 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Expected_Time_Tab">Expected Time Tab</h5>
<p>Complete the fields in the Expected Time tab to set a timeout interval for the process user to execute this activity. When the time specified in the Duration field has expired, the activity will be considered overdue. If an Activity is overdue, the Due Date property will be shown in red on the process execution screen and the process will appear in the "Overdue" tab of the My Processes dashlet.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/97b73b25-868d-e15c-bb61-550302b6e3e0.png" alt="" width="328" height="213" /></p>
<h4 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Users_Setting">Users Setting</h4>
<p>The "Users..." setting controls which user will be responsible for executing the process activity form. When a process reaches the activity in a flow, the process user will see a line item in their Processes dashlet or Processes module list view. The form type and other options must be separately configured in the "<a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Forms_Setting">Forms...</a>" setting. </p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>The Assignment Method chosen here refers only to the user that will execute the process, or "Process User". References to the Sugar record's assigned user are labeled "Assigned To User".</p>
<p>To configure the Users setting for an activity, right click on the icon and select "Users...".<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b492416d-78fe-50e5-c16e-550302186501.png" alt="" width="195" height="139" /></p>
<p>A configuration window will open. Choose one of the following process user assignment methods from the dropdown list:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Static_Assignment">Static Assignment</a></li>
    <li><a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Round_Robin">Round Robin</a> (default)</li>
    <li><a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Self_Service">Self Service</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These three options are explained in detail in the following sections.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>If this activity type is not properly configured, it will default to the Round Robin process-assignment method for the Global team.</p>
<p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8579dd42-7fbe-7777-17fe-557915392a49.png" alt="assign-method2" width="352" height="122" /></p>
<h5 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Static_Assignment">Static Assignment</h5>
<p>Choose "Static Assignment" to assign process Activities to a specific process user. You can also select one of the following variable user types:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Current User</strong> : The Current User refers to the last process user who has been defined in the process definition. If no process user has been previously defined, the Current User will be the user who is in the Assigned To field of the targeted Sugar record.</li>
    <li><strong>Record Owner</strong> : The Record Owner is the user who is in the Assigned To field of the targeted Sugar record.</li>
    <li><strong>Supervisor</strong> : When selected, the supervisor of the user who is in the Assigned To field of the targeted Sugar record will be prompted to execute this process activity. This relationship must be configured in the "Reports to" field of the Users module. For more information about editing User fields, please refer to the <a href="#ec10f00-236f-9c84-9827-551b22807391_User_Fields">User Management</a> page of the Administration Guide.</li>
</ul>
<p>Static Assignment will disable the Team configuration option in this window and require only the Select Process User field to complete the configuration.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5f65f6b3-81fa-81d5-6695-557917d0228e.png" alt="static-new" width="354" height="240" /></p>
<h5 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Round-Robin">Round-Robin</h5>
<p>Choose the Round Robin assignment method to equally distribute process activities to the <a href="#a40-f304-eea1-4447-551b22d55799_Team_Membership_Types">explicit members of a team</a> in a take-your-turn fashion. For example, if Jim and Sally belong to team "East," a Round Robin distribution for team East will assign the activity to Jim the first time it runs, to Sally the second time it runs, and then to Jim again on the third execution (and so on). The processing order of Round Robin activities is based on the Created By date of the user record in the Users module. </p>
<p>Round Robin will disable the Select Process User option in this window and require only the "Select Process User From Team" field to complete the configuration.</p>
<p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/56c60721-894d-d06d-bcfb-557917136a0d.png" alt="robin-new" width="387" height="263" /></p>
<h5 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Self_Service">Self Service</h5>
<p>Choose the Self Service assignment method to allow any user of a specified team to claim the activity in a process. By enabling users to claim process activities as they have time for them, Self Service assignment reduces congestion in the workflow. Self Service activities that are ready to be claimed will appear in the Self Service Processes tab of the Processes dashlet.</p>
<p>Self Service will disable the Select Process User option in this window and require only the "Select Process User From Team" field to complete the configuration.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/40635b95-45bf-0cd8-d6ac-5579170d0b96.png" alt="selfserve-new" width="384" height="263" /></p>
<h3 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Adding_Actions">Adding Actions</h3>
<p>Actions are automated elements used to execute a business rule, create or update a Sugar record, or designate a process user. Actions are completed by the Process Author engine and do not require any human interaction to execute. There are five types of actions available in the Visual Designer and they are all represented by a single icon on the design toolbar:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/2072cda6-ec93-48ec-d3ae-55791df13311.png" alt="toolbar-new-actions" width="600" height="158" /></p>
<p>The action must be configured after adding it to the designer canvas. The five available action types are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Business_Rule">Business Rule</a></li>
    <li><a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Assign_User">Assign User</a></li>
    <li><a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Round_Robin">Round Robin</a></li>
    <li><a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Change_Field">Change Field</a></li>
    <li><a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Add_Related_Record">Add Related Record</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To add any of these actions to a process definition, drag and drop the Action icon from the design toolbar onto the Visual Designer canvas:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/99bf176a-101c-3adb-2433-550302b23771.png" alt="" width="105" height="140" /><br /><strong>Note</strong>: The Action will have an error alert (!) icon warning you to add an outgoing sequence flow element. This is normal and will disappear after you create the next element and connect it to the action. Fo more information about element errors, refer to the <a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Resolving_Errors_in_the_Element_Errors_Panel">Resolving Errors in the Element Errors Panel</a> section of this page.</p>
<p>The Action will display a question mark image until it has been configured. Right click on the Action icon to configure the action type. By default, an Action element is configured as type "Unassigned". This is simply to prevent a non-configured Action from affecting the Process flow. You must choose one of the Action Types and then configure the appropriate settings.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/cfdbfd75-a400-7afe-f7be-550302581d30.png" alt="" width="355" height="222" /></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Settings</strong> : This option will be grayed out until an action type is selected.</li>
    <li><strong>Action Type</strong> : Choose the type of action this element will execute. These options are explained in detail in the remaining <a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Adding_Actions">Adding Actions</a> sections of this page.</li>
    <li><strong>Delete</strong> : Remove the element from the canvas.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Business_Rule">Business Rule</h4>
<p>This Action type allows the administrator to select a <a href="#ea20e8f-7234-acd4-1983-551b22de680d_Process_Business_Rules">process business rule</a> in order to return a corresponding value. Business Rule actions must be followed by a Gateway element to analyze the rule's return value. Follow these steps to add a process business rule to the process definition:</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>The process business rule must already be configured and saved in the <a href="#ea20e8f-7234-acd4-1983-551b22de680d_Process_Business_Rules">Process Business Rules</a> module in order for it to be available in the Action's settings, and must utilize the same target module as the process definition.</p>

<p>A Gateway is represented as a diamond in the Visual Designer.</p>
<p>Gateway elements are represented by the fourth group of icons on the design toolbar. There are two icons that each enable at least one type of configurable diverging or converging moment.</p>
<p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/ea33c086-9720-fdca-d005-55792078987f.png" alt="toolbar-new-gateways" width="600" height="169" /></p>
<p>The four types of Gateways that can be configured are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Exclusive_Gateways">Exclusive Gateways</a></li>
    <li><a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Inclusive_Gateways">Inclusive Gateways</a></li>
    <li><a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Parallel_Gateways">Parallel Gateways</a></li>
    <li><a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Event-Based_Gateways">Event-Based Gateways</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To add a Gateway element to the Process Definition, drag and drop one of the two Gateway elements icons onto the designer canvas. Right click on the diamond-shaped icon that appears in order to define a Gateway type and configure the Gateway's settings.</p>
<h4 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Exclusive_Gateways">Exclusive Gateways</h4>
<p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/df54b2a9-2735-6a5c-deb4-5503025aa232.png" alt="" width="60" height="54" /></p>
<p>Only one path can be defined from an exclusive Gateway, and it will be the one that accomplishes the condition. If several criteria are true, the priority will be higher on the one that lies further up the configuration. If no criteria are fulfilled the flow will be routed through the default one.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>If no criteria are accomplished, and if you have not set a default flow, the Process Definition's flow will be blocked by this element.</p>
<p><strong>Converging</strong></p>
<p>This Gateway joins multiple streams in a single thread, but only takes the first flow that reaches the Gateway; the other flows will not be evaluated after that. There are no settings for this element. To configure this Gateway as a converging element, right click on the Gateway element and select Direction &gt; Converging:</p>
<p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/37afe38c-f166-0c8c-e41d-55030267fc87.png" alt="" width="304" height="179" /></p>
<p><strong>Diverging</strong></p>
<p>Follow these steps to configure a diverging exclusive Gateway.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Drag the exclusive Gateway icon onto the designer canvas.</li>
    <li>A diverging Gateway requires two or more subsequent elements (any combination of intermediate events, end events, actions, and/or activities). These must be placed on the canvas and <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/135_Process_Author/03_Process_Definitions/index.html#Adding_Sequence_Flow_Elements_(Lines_and_Arrows)">connectors</a> must join the elements on the canvas before the Gateway can be configured. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/18f5284c-228b-aa76-5be1-550302c154ff.png" alt="" width="242" height="120" /></li>
    <li>Once the Gateway has been connected to the subsequent elements, right click on the Gateway icon and select Direction &gt; Diverging:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/f0a49135-8393-8383-9529-55030287b2fc.png" alt="" width="286" height="114" /></li>
    <li>Specify a default flow for the Gateway. If no criteria are fulfilled, the flow will be routed through the default one. From the visual designer canvas, right click on the Gateway icon and hover over the Default Flow option. A menu will appear listing all of the potential flow routes from the Gateway. Select the element that should occur when no criteria are met by the others.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/2b42c3db-f4ca-b930-5612-5503027dbf11.png" alt="" width="311" height="160" /></li>
    <li>Right click on the element again and select the option "Settings".<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/c2ea34e3-30a1-f8c5-df51-55030202d759.png" alt="" width="178" height="186" /></li>
    <li>A window will display to construct criteria for each Activity that the Gateway is directed to. Click inside the criteria fields to display a criteria builder window. A separate criteria window will appear for each subsequent element that was connected to the Gateway in step 2.</li>
    <li>Refer to the <a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Creating_Conditions_for_Events_and_Actions">Creating Conditions for Events and Actions</a> section of this page for criteria builder instructions.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Inclusive_Gateways">Inclusive Gateways</h4>
<p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a8446e32-5c23-3601-fffb-550302032564.png" alt="" width="54" height="52" /></p>
<p>Inclusive Gateways are diverging elements that create one or more parallel flows based on one or more conditions that accomplish "TRUE" in their evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>If no criteria are accomplished, and if you have not set a default flow, the Process Definition's flow will be blocked by this element.</p>
<p>To create an Inclusive Gateway, drag and drop the solid Gateway icon onto the canvas. Right click on the element icon and confirm that "Do Nothing" is grayed out by default in the "Result" menu, indicating that it is the active End event type. If it is not grayed out, click on "Do Nothing" to make it the active End event type.</p>
<p><strong>Diverging</strong></p>
<p>This element follows only one direction, the diverging one. Thus, this Gateway defines the direction of flow through one or more paths, which will be those defined as true. If no criteria are fulfilled flow will be routed through the default one.</p>
<p><strong>Settings</strong> : Right click on the element and select the option Settings, a new window will be displayed to construct criteria for each Activity that the Gateway is directed to. Click on the criteria field to display the criteria builder floating menu. After that, if you want to save your changes click on the button "Save", otherwise, click on "Cancel".</p>
<h4 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Parallel_Gateways">Parallel Gateways</h4>
<p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/3c515bd9-b0bf-aa70-a975-5503026f8797.png" alt="" width="51" height="49" /></p>
<p>Parallel Gateways are used to synchronize parallel flows without evaluating any condition. This Gateway is used in both ways: divergent (directs parallel flows) and convergent (receives parallel flows), each one is explained in the next sections.</p>
<p><strong>Diverging</strong></p>
<p>This Gateway divides the flow into two or more elements in parallel. There are no settings for this element.</p>
<p><strong>Converging</strong></p>
<p>This Gateway joins multiple streams into a single thread. The process flow will continue only if all other flows that converge into this Gateway have arrived to it. There are no settings for this element.</p>
<h4 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Event-Based_Gateways">Event-Based Gateways</h4>
<p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/70e252fb-c2b6-ef53-ffe6-550302dc212a.png" alt="" width="54" height="53" /></p>
<p>Event-based Gateways evaluate only Wait or Receive Message events. There are no configuration settings for these elements.</p>
<p>Drag and drop this element onto the canvas; by default it will be set as Exclusive. To convert it into Event-Based, right click on it and go to the option Convert. Select the option "Event-Based Gateway".</p>
<p>This Gateway stops the flow until one of the expected events are accomplished, then defines the flow direction only by one path, which will be the first event to be run.</p>
<h3 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Adding_End_Events">Adding End Events</h3>
<p>End events are represented by the fifth icon grouping on the design toolbar. There is one icon that can be configured three different ways after placing it on the Designer Canvas.</p>
<p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/37127005-780d-4add-ac14-5579ae60ca04.png" alt="toolbar-end-new" width="600" height="179" /></p>
<p>To define an End event type, drag the End event icon onto the Designer Canvas and then right click on the red circle. Choose "Result" from the menu, and then find the appropriate End event type. Note that the active End event type will be grayed out because it is already selected, and the default type is "Do Nothing".<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/9c9ba0e0-2f56-1e7c-cf54-550302feb198.png" alt="" width="328" height="207" /></p>
<p>The three types of End event are:</p>
<h4 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Do_Nothing">Do Nothing</h4>
<p><strong><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/14e3ffb8-2ca7-f763-165c-55030215ec75.png" alt="" width="40" height="38" /><br /></strong>Most often used for sequential processes, this event ends a thread of the Process Definition without doing anything. It will not affect parallel threads that may be running simultaneously in the process. Those threads will continue to run uninterrupted by the Do Nothing End event. This event does not need any configuration; it is set by default when you drag and drop an End event onto the canvas.<strong><br /></strong><br />To create a "Do Nothing" End event, drag and drop the End event icon into the canvas. Right click on the element icon and confirm that "Do Nothing" is grayed out by default in the "Result" menu, indicating that it is the active End event type. If it is not grayed out, click on "Do Nothing" to make it the active End event type.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d27adc02-a05d-2bb0-c12f-550302a9d18d.png" alt="" width="311" height="121" /></p>

The Terminate Process event does not need any configuration.<br /><br />To create a "Terminate Process" End event, drag and drop the End event icon into the canvas. Right click on the element icon then choose "Terminate Process" in the Result menu to make it the active End event type.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/2e9b42b9-b76c-4055-5a1b-550302c88cf4.png" alt="" width="313" height="138" /></p>

Please note that Process Author can only send email templates created in the Process Email Templates module and cannot send email messages created in any other part of the Sugar application. If no Process Email Template is specified in the event configuration, then the Process will terminate but no message will be sent.</p>
<p>To create a Send Message End event, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Drag and drop the End event icon into the canvas. Right click on the element icon then choose "Send Message" in the Result menu to make this the active End event type.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/ebf3476c-4246-a7af-27a9-550302d2e769.png" alt="" width="307" height="132" /></li>
    <li>Right click on the canvas icon and select the option "Settings" to configure the event. A new window will appear:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5cece82e-c201-7aa0-f87e-550302e4f805.png" alt="" width="252" height="230" />

<h4 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Mathematical_Operations">Mathematical Operations</h4>
<p>Mathematical operations utilize mathematical operators in conjunction with the Fixed Date, Time Span, and Sugar Date Variable options to specify conditions on an event. Mathematical operators can also be used to calculate a number value for a Sugar field using a combination of Sugar field variables and constant values. Mathematical operations are defined inside a formula builder in the process definition's design view.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Mathematical Operations may be used for Wait events, Change Field Actions, and Add Related Record Actions.</p>
<p>Mathematical operators primarily serve two purposes:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Calculating Dates</strong> : Use addition (+) and subtraction (-) to create a date that is relative to another date. For example, set a Due Date field two weeks after a record's Start Date field (Start Date + 2w). <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/9cfb4399-5ccd-b85a-89d2-550302d7b3d2.png" alt="" width="212" height="150" /></li>
    <li><strong>Calculating Numeric Values</strong> : Use addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (x), and division (/) to create a calculated value relative to another Sugar Field. For example, set Total amount to the sum of several number fields minus a $200 discount.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/10d3e20d-0bf0-8ad0-2f25-550302c46bdd.png" alt="" width="226" height="156" /></li>
</ul>
<h5 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Fixed_Date">Fixed Date</h5>
<p>The Fixed Date option enables the administrator to specify a formal, static date as a field value or as a variable in a formula that will calculate a field value. For example, if all opportunities in a process are expected to close at the end of the year, create a Change Value Action that uses Fixed Date to change all opportunities' Expected Close Date fields to December 31, 2015.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Fixed Dates may be used in mathematical operations for Wait events, Change Field Actions, and Add Related Record Actions.</p>
<p>To reference a Fixed Date, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click inside the date field and then click on "Constants" and select "Fixed Date":<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/481987d6-1e5e-04b8-b4ad-5503025a73cf.png" alt="" width="233" height="161" /></li>
    <li>The window will transition to a single Date field, Click inside the Date field to reveal a calendar picker. Navigate from month to month using the &lt; (back) and &gt; (forward) symbols near the month label. Click on the date that will be used in the formula.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/ca1c0e9c-16bc-cf7d-f47e-5503027f4b19.png" alt="" width="157" height="210" /></li>
    <li>Click the Submit button to move the selected date onto the formula builder canvas:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/3fde66e6-36fc-83c3-5240-5503026999b7.png" alt="" width="162" height="215" /><br /><strong>Note:</strong> If the date submitted in this step is the static date for the field value, then the formula is complete. If the Fixed Date is only one component of a larger formula that will be used to determine a field value, then the Fixed Date should be entered in the order it is expected in the formula along with a logical combination of Time Span, Sugar Date Variables, and/or Mathematical Operators.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Time_Span">Time Span</h5>
<p>The Time Span option allows the passage of time within a date formula. For example, if a Due Date should be set for two weeks after a record's Start Date, build a formula that uses Time Span "2 weeks" as a variable (Start Date + 2w).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Time Spans may be used in mathematical operations for Wait events, Change Field Actions, and Add Related Record Actions.</p>
<p>To reference a time span, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click inside the date field and then click on "Constants" and select "Time Span":<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e10e64b2-c7e4-6dde-c6fa-5503024bb6b8.png" alt="" width="247" height="181" /></li>
    <li>The next window will display a Value field and a Units field. Use these two fields together to create a logical time span phrase (e.g., 2 weeks would be set as Value=2; Units=weeks). Time spans can be specified in years, months, weeks, days, hours, or minutes.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/7cccac00-50a4-f372-4864-5503024cdd54.png" alt="" width="166" height="139" /></li>
    <li>Click the Submit button to move the selected time span onto the formula builder canvas:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/afb5aba6-1ce1-7fbe-d5c6-5503023af063.png" alt="" width="161" height="209" /><br /><strong>Note:</strong> If the time span is the only component of the date formula, it will be interpreted as {TODAY} + {TIME SPAN} where TODAY is the date and time that the process executes this element in the process definition. If the time span is only one component of a larger formula that will be used to determine a field value, then the time span should be entered in the order it is expected in the formula along with a logical combination of Fixed Date, Sugar Date Variables, and/or Mathematical Operators.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Sugar_Date_Variables">Sugar Date Variables</h5>
<p>Sugar Date Variables are references to date fields on a Sugar record. They can be used to add context to a date formula (e.g., Date Created + 1 month) or referenced independently (e.g., an action or event that triggers on Expected Close Date).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Sugar Date Variables may be used in mathematical operations for Wait events, Change Field Actions, and Add Related Record Actions.</p>
<p>To reference a Sugar date variable, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click inside the date field and then click on "Fields". A list of available modules will appear (the target module and any available related modules). Click on the arrow adjacent to the desired module:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/2078e483-111e-9449-878b-55030293da91.png" alt="" width="239" height="165" /></li>
    <li>After clicking on the module name, the window will reveal a list of all available date fields for that module. Click on the date field and it will instantly appear in the formula builder window:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5a42d75f-08bf-c164-5ae2-550302bcc7a8.png" alt="" width="168" height="285" /><br /><strong>Note:</strong> If the date variable is the only component of the date formula, then the formula is complete. If the date variable is only one component of a larger formula that will be used to determine a field value, then the variable should be entered in the order it is expected in the formula along with a logical combination of Time Span, Fixed Dates, and/or Mathematical Operators.</li>

<h3 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Creating_Conditions_for_Activities_and_Gateways">Creating Conditions for Activities and Gateways</h3>
<p>Form activities and gateway elements can evaluate user responses to forms or business rules that have been created by the administrator.</p>
<p>The available evaluations are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong><a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Form_Response_Evaluations">Form Response Evaluations</a></strong> : Configure this type of criteria for gateways that follow a form activity.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Business_Rule_Evaluations">Business Rule Evaluations</a></strong>: Configure this type of criteria for gateways that follow a business rule action.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Form_Response_Evaluations">Form Response Evaluations</h4>
<p>If a process contains an Approve/Reject activity, it must be followed by a gateway with a form response evaluation. To configure this evaluation, follow these steps:</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>A diverging Gateway requires two or more subsequent elements (any combination of intermediate events, end events, actions, and/or activities). These must be placed on the canvas and connectors must join the elements on the canvas before the Gateway can be configured.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Drag an Activity element onto the design canvas as explained in <a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Adding_Form_Activities">Adding Form Activities</a>.</li>
    <li>Drag an Exclusive Gateway element onto the design canvas to the right of the Activity.</li>
    <li>Drag two or more action, intermediate, or end events onto the canvas to the right of the Gateway.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/68a31d56-e19d-f693-7c16-557b663b666c.png" alt="activity-gateway" width="343" height="168" /></li>
    <li>Connect the activity to the gateway and the gateway to the subsequent elements using <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/135_Process_Author/03_Process_Definitions/index.html#Adding_Sequence_Flow_Elements_(Lines_and_Arrows)">Sequence Connectors</a>.</li>
    <li>Right click on the gateway element and specify a default flow. This will be the direction that the flow takes if no criteria are accomplished within the gateway element. For this example, the default flow is set to the action labeled, "Approve". Please note that the default flow options will not be available until the corresponding elements have been placed on the canvas and connected to the gateway.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/3f0ec075-22b8-86dc-fb9c-557df7117c62.png" alt="default-flow" width="281" height="211" /><br />A hash mark will indicate that a default flow has been successfully configured:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/195609d7-00b8-2482-9a32-557e023aa0bf.png" alt="hash" width="228" height="141" /></li>
    <li>Next, right click on the gateway element again and select "Settings". Note that only the non-default outcome or outcomes will need to be configured. For the current example, we set the default flow to "Approve" so there is one criteria window, which represents the one non-default element in this example.</li>
    <li>Click inside the Criteria window to reveal evaluation options. The only required evaluation for a form activity is the "Form Response Evaluation". Click on Evaluations &gt; Form Response Evaluation and then select the form response that will result in the non-default flow. In this example, the form response must be "Rejected" or else the default flow will take over. Click "Submit" to move the condition to the Criteria window. If multiple criteria are required, click on the AND, OR, NOT, and parentheses operators as needed and insert additional conditional statements.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/33f4700a-595d-d30b-801c-557e07f4cbb0.png" alt="reject" width="327" height="197" /><br /><strong>Note:</strong> Despite a form activity having two outcomes (approval and rejection), it is possible to configure additional outcomes using a combination of criteria beyond the form response. For example, a separate outcome may be configured for:
        <ul>
            <li>Form Response = Rejected AND Status = New</li>
            <li>Form Response = Approved AND Status = New</li>
            <li>Form Response = Approved AND Status = Closed</li>
            <li>else Default Flow : In other words, if none of the above criteria are accomplished, continue with the default flow element. Please note that the default element does not need to be configured. It will always be the outcome when all other criteria evaluate to false. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Only one outcome can occur from an exclusive Gateway, and it will be the one that accomplishes the condition. If several criteria are true, the priority will be higher on the one that lies further up the configuration. To change the priority order of a Gateway that is directed toward multiple elements:
        <ul>
            <li>Right click on the Gateway element and select the option "Settings".<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/c2ea34e3-30a1-f8c5-df51-55030202d759.png" alt="" width="178" height="186" /></li>
            <li>There will be a criteria builder window for each related element. Place the mouse pointer to the left or right side of the criteria fields and the pointer will change its appearance to a standard "move" cursor type. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a7310104-705b-11fb-ef9b-5503024f6230.png" alt="" width="426" height="246" /></li>
            <li>Drag and drop the criteria fields into the desired sequence. This order will set the priority of the Gateway criteria.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/691aff79-739b-540c-db21-550302dee43e.png" alt="" width="426" height="247" /></li>
            <li>When you are satisfied with the conditions and their processing order, click "Save" to preserve the changes and return to the visual designer canvas.</li>

<h4 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Business_Rule_Evaluations">Business Rule Evaluations</h4>
<p>When referencing a process business rule within a process definition, the action must be followed by a gateway with a business rules evaluation. </p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>A diverging Gateway requires two or more subsequent elements (any combination of intermediate events, end events, actions, and/or activities). These must be placed on the canvas and connectors must join the elements on the canvas before the Gateway can be configured.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Drag an Action element onto the design canvas and configure it as explained in the <a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Business_Rule">Business Rule</a> section of this page.</li>
    <li>Drag an Exclusive Gateway element onto the design canvas to the right of the Action.</li>
    <li>Drag two or more action, intermediate, or end events onto the canvas to the right of the Gateway.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/873a5cb6-70c2-122a-40a5-557ed94befb6.png" alt="rule-action" width="374" height="181" /></li>
    <li>Connect the action to the gateway and the gateway to the subsequent elements using <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/135_Process_Author/03_Process_Definitions/index.html#Adding_Sequence_Flow_Elements_(Lines_and_Arrows)">Sequence Connectors</a>. Notice that, in the example here, there are three potential outcomes for the gateway. </li>
    <li>Right click on the gateway element and specify a default flow. This will be the direction that the flow takes if no criteria are accomplished within the gateway element. For this example, the default flow is set to the action labeled, "Assign to Jim". Please note that the default flow options will not be available until the corresponding elements have been placed on the canvas and connected to the gateway.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a6b98cb7-1bab-0755-ca9d-557edf2b9349.png" alt="rule-default" width="331" height="236" /><br />A hash mark will indicate that a default flow has been successfully configured:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/c92b21b5-7c25-c50a-cbb2-557ee09d6c65.png" alt="rule-hash" width="322" height="127" /></li>
    <li>Next, right click on the gateway element again and select "Settings". Only the non-default outcome or outcomes will need to be configured. For the current example, we set the default flow to "Assign to Jim" so there are two criteria windows, which represent the two non-default elements in this example.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d8940a54-deba-a33b-d00c-557ee1867861.png" alt="rule-criteria" width="416" height="205" /></li>
    <li>Click inside the first Criteria window to reveal the evaluation options. The only required evaluation for a business rule is the "Business Rules Evaluation". Follow these steps to configure the Business Rules Evaluation:</li>
    <li>Click on Evaluations &gt; Business Rules Evaluation. The Business Rule field will appear and display all of the Business Rules that have been referenced by action elements in the current process definition.</li>
    <li>Select the business rule that this gateway is evaluating.</li>
    <li>The Response field will evaluate the "Return Value" designated in the process business rule. Type the Return Value that, when returned by the business rule, will result in the current process path. For example, if a Return Value of 1 causes the process to end, type "1" (no quotes) into the Response field for the End element's Criteria.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/3c930fe8-b766-9a06-29d0-557f2897a595.png" alt="biz-eval" width="418" height="217" /><br /><strong>Note:</strong> Process business rule "Return Values" will always convert to text for evaluation within a process definition.</li>
    <li>Click "Submit" to move the condition to the Criteria window.</li>
    <li>If multiple criteria are required for any one flow direction, click on the AND, OR, NOT, and parentheses operators as needed and insert additional conditional statements.</li>
    <li>Continue configuring Criteria for all possible flow outcomes.</li>
    <li>Only one outcome can occur from an exclusive Gateway, and it will be the one that accomplishes the condition. If several criteria are true, the priority will be higher on the one that lies further up the configuration. To change the priority order of a Gateway that is directed toward multiple elements:

            <li>There will be a criteria builder window for each related element. Place the mouse pointer to the left or right side of the criteria fields and the pointer will change its appearance to a standard "move" cursor type. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a7310104-705b-11fb-ef9b-5503024f6230.png" alt="" width="426" height="246" /></li>
            <li>Drag and drop the criteria fields into the desired sequence. This order will set the priority of the Gateway criteria.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/691aff79-739b-540c-db21-550302dee43e.png" alt="" width="426" height="247" /></li>

<h2 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Configuring_Process_Termination_Settings">Configuring Process Termination Settings</h2>
<p>A well-formed process definition will include termination conditions. If a process' target record meets these conditions, the process instance will force stop and display a status of "Terminated" in the Process Management list. This setting is important to prevent conflicts between multiple running processes or conflicts between Process Author and other automated parts of your Sugar instance (e.g. Workflows, Sugar Logic, or third party customizations).</p>
<p>Follow these steps to define termination conditions for a process definition:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to the Visual Design canvas for the relevant process definition.</li>
    <li>Find a blank spot on the design canvas and right-click to access the Process Definition's general settings.</li>
    <li>Click on "Process Definition".<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b5385b10-12e0-cb19-0b8d-5543ec9e6248.png" alt="right-click" width="221" height="99" /></li>
    <li>The Process Definition settings will appear. Here you can edit the record-level settings such as the Name and Description, but most importantly, set Terminate Process criteria for this process definition.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/23a7a7e3-fe17-10fe-72de-5543ec41609a.png" alt="prodef-settings" width="298" height="191" /></li>

<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>
<p>The Comment element allows admins to mark up the designer canvas with helpful annotations connected to Action and Activity elements. While all elements can be re-labeled, further explanation may come in handy to explain more complex Process Definitions. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/69f10d39-0a0c-5051-734e-5579b1d8e2da.png" alt="toolbar-new-comments" width="556" height="93" /></p>
<p>To insert a comment onto the Designer Canvas, simply drag and drop the comment icon onto the canvas and then double click on the text "Text Annotation" to type a comment. Hit Enter to preserve the comment.<br /><br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/c57f7d94-921f-b644-fce6-550302bcd1b7.png" alt="" width="447" height="127" /></p>
<p><strong>Editing Tools</strong></p>
<p>Common editing tasks can be accessed on the right-most side of the Designer Toolbar. The three icons represent Undo, Redo, and Save.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d97289c5-2a49-ea1d-16ee-5579b26ffb5b.png" alt="toolbar-new-edit" width="549" height="99" /></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Undo : </strong>Click to undo the last change made in the Process Definition (up to 25 changes). When an undo action restores a design element on the page, it will not restore the element's configuration.</li>
    <li><strong>Redo : </strong>Click to redo the last change made in the Process Definition (up to 25 changes). When a redo action restores a design element on the page, it will not restore the element's configuration.</li>
    <li><strong>Save : </strong>This control allows users to save all changes made by them on the Process Definition design. This button is enabled only when there are unsaved changes. Keep in mind that the Visual Designer auto-saves your work every 15 seconds. To save your process, click on this icon in the Designer's elements.</li>
</ul>
<p>When an enabled process definition's design is edited, any running process will immediately adapt to the new flow pattern. Therefore, it is best practice to disable a process definition before making changes to its design. Disabling the process definition will prevent running processes from adapting to the new flow prematurely. Please note that changing the process definition's status to "Disabled" will not cause any interruptions to already running processes. Upon re-enabling the process definition, any processes still running will adapt to the new flow.</p>
<h2 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Resolving_Errors_in_the_Element_Errors_Panel">Resolving Errors in the Element Errors Panel</h2>
<p>When using the Visual Designer to create a Process Definition, real-time configuration errors are displayed to the right of the design canvs in the Element Errors panel.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/58990a70-3597-ec70-5cbb-5579bd174f03.png" alt="resolve-errors" width="586" height="214" /></p>
<p>If an element on the canvas contains a flow error, the Visual Designer will place a red exclamation point icon over the element until the error is resolved. This error icon will always have a corresponding explanation in the Element Errors panel.</p>
<p>Some errors will occur and then resolve themselves naturally as the Process Definition is pieced together. For example, all elements will be considered in an error state until the appropriate connectors have been inserted in between elements as shown in this example:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/46f60ae5-ca18-551c-b532-5503026799e9.png" alt="" width="542" height="224" /></p>
<ul>
    <li>Place and configure a Start event and an Intermediate event. The Element Errors panel will display three errors because:
        <ol>
            <li>A Start event must have a connector to some second element.</li>
            <li>An Intermediate event must have a connector from an earlier element.</li>
            <li>An Intermediate event must have a connector to a next step or element.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>

    <li>Resolve the third and final Element Error by creating an End or Intermediate event after the "Run Business Rule" element and then place a connector between the two. Note that inserting a new Intermediate event or Gateway (instead of an End event) will result in a new error until its outgoing sequence flow is resolved. Placing an End event and its connector, though, will resolve all sequence flow Element Errors.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/7f709951-9f12-4334-d84c-550302c4ca55.png" alt="" width="517" height="154" /></li>

<p>At any time during the design of the process definition, you can exit the visual designer by clicking the X at the top of the screen, just above the Element Errors panel. While the visual designer automatically saves your progress every 15 seconds, you should still be sure to press the save button before exiting the designer. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a0351507-5627-dc5b-8515-5579be44d13e.png" alt="toolbar-exit" width="747" height="88" /></p>
<h2 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Enabling_and_Disabling_Process_Definitions">Enabling and Disabling Process Definitions</h2>
<p>It is necessary to enable process definitions when their design is complete. It is also possible to disable process definitions when needed. The following sections explain how to enable or disable a process definition. </p>
<h3 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Enabling_Process_Definitions">Enabling Process Definitions</h3>
<p>New process definitions are set to "Disabled" by default. This is a preventative feature that ensures a process instance is not triggered inadvertently during the design phase. After the design is fully configured, exit the Visual Designer and set the process definition to "Enabled". There are two ways to enable a process definition:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Enabling Via Dashlet : </strong>Visit your <a href="#e850d25-94e3-38db-da11-551b22b61fca_Creating_a_Process_Author_Dashboard">Process Author dashboard</a>. Disabled process definitions will be listed in the "Disabled" tab of the Process Definitions dashlet. Find the Enable/Disable icon adjacent to the relevant process definition. Click on the icon and processes will immediately begin running when the process definition's conditions are met.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/9f78725d-ae3f-b180-3f8e-5542a225bc36.png" alt="dash-enable" width="325" height="117" /></li>
    <li><strong>Enabling Via List View : </strong>Navigate to the Process Definitions' list view by clicking on the Process Definitions module tab. From list view, identify the process definition that you want to enable. Click on that row's actions menu and select "Enable" from the dropdown list.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5cf90ca8-46d1-1090-e0b5-55429f957976.png" alt="enable-list-sm" width="454" height="258" /></li>
</ul>
<p>The process definition's Status will change from red to green "Enabled". Processes will immediately begin running when the process definition's conditions are met.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/56e5e06e-f9af-2dc2-d621-55429fff7d17.png" alt="enabled" width="442" height="55" /></p>
<h3 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Disabling_Process_Definitions">Disabling Process Definitions</h3>
<p>To disable a process definition, use either of the two techniques explained in the <a href="#e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_Enabling_Process_Definitions">Enabling Process Definitions</a> section, choosing "Disabled" instead of "Enabled". Please note that disabling a process definition will only prevent it from triggering new processes. Any in-progress process instances will continue running without interruption.<br /><br /></p>
<h2 id="e940dc2-249a-5afa-d527-551b22965320_The_Process_Definitions_Module_Tab">The Process Definitions Module Tab</h2>
<p>The Process Definitions module tab is located on the navigation bar at the top of the Sugar screen when the administrator is engaging with the Process Definitions module. Click the tab to access the Process Definitions list view. You may also click the triangle in the Process Definitions tab to display the Actions, Recently Viewed, and Favorites menus. The Actions menu allows you to perform important actions within the module. The Recently Viewed menu displays the list of process definitions you last viewed in the module. The Favorites menu displays the list of process definitions you most recently marked as favorites in the module.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/6d4d1b1e-e0c0-5eaa-7661-550302d91f24.png" alt="" width="226" height="224" /></p>

<p>If you do not see the Process Definitions module tab in Sugar, please check the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You must be an administrator user to access the Process Definitions module or the Process Definitions module tab.</li>
    <li>The Process Definitions module may be marked as hidden in your user preferences which will prevent the module tab from being displayed. Navigate to your user profile (upper right of Sugar), click the Advanced tab, and check the Layout Options section. If you see the Process Definitions module in the Hide Modules list, simply move it to the Display Modules list and save. For more information on hiding and displaying modules, please refer to the Layout Options section of the Getting Started documentation.</li>
    <li>The administrator may have disabled the Process Definitions module for your entire Sugar instance. Reach out to your Sugar administrator to have the Process Definitions module displayed. For more information on displaying and hiding modules throughout Sugar, please refer to the Developer Tools documentation in the Administration guide.</li>

<div>
    <p>The Dropdown Editor allows administrators to view, modify, and create dropdown lists which can be added as fields in Sugar. Since dropdown lists are not module specific, they are stored and managed through the Dropdown Editor. Please note that the dropdown list can only be associated to a Dropdown, Multiselect, and Radio type field via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on associating dropdown lists to the different field types, please refer to the <a href="#b08267-09fc-6a2c-433f-5606f925d54c_Fields">Studio</a> documentation.</p>

    </div>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Certain dropdown lists cannot be edited via the Dropdown editor as they are controlled by a separate area (e.g. Contract Types, Releases, etc.) of the Admin page. These include dropdown lists for the <a href="#id-65bbe5f0-8524-ae05-5303-5606f96f3721">Forecasting</a>, <a href="#id-65b91033-7812-09b3-de0b-5606f9307e82">Bug Tracker</a>, <a href="#id-65bd5af6-150d-ccd1-d8d3-5606f9fb8dd4">Contracts</a>, and <a href="#id-65b7b3d6-133b-168f-8d99-5606f93744b2">Products and Quotes</a> modules.

    <p>The Dropdown Editor displays all existing dropdown lists in two separate sections (Dropdowns list, Dropdown Editor) on the page. The Dropdowns list to the left of the page displays the dropdown lists in alphabetical order. The Dropdown Editor tab displays the dropdown lists in columns and allows you to view more of the lists at once instead of scrolling down a single list. <img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b2c39c56-9e01-ecc3-9f7f-550300b361d8.png" alt="DD_lists_67_view" width="621" height="209"></p>
    <p>Once you locate the dropdown list you are looking for, click the list's name to open the Edit Dropdown tab where you can view and edit the list. The Edit Dropdown tab displays the name, language dropdown, and the list of item names and display labels. The list's order here matches the order they will be displayed when using the dropdown in Sugar records. Reorder the list by dragging and dropping the items into the desired positions.

    <div>
        <p>If your organization uses Sugar in languages other than English, Sugar can display translated dropdown lists for each language used. For example, Sugar will display French dropdown items when a user is logged into Sugar in French. You must provide the translations for each language by specifying display labels for each dropdown item. First, finalize your list's items by <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.6/Ent/Administration_Guide/Developer_Tools/#Editing_Dropdown_Lists">adding or removing items</a> since the item names (a.k.a. database values) and order of items will be consistent across all languages. Choose the desired language in the Language dropdown above the list. Then, click the pencil icon for each item and enter a translated display label. When all labels have been translated, click "Save" to preserve your changes. After saving, the list will automatically be displayed in English, but you can change the Language dropdown again to check your labels.

    <p>Please note that the name of the dropdown list cannot be changed once created. Also, dropdown lists cannot be deleted since they can span multiple modules in Sugar and cause important data to be lost if removed in error. Once the necessary modifications have been made, click "Save" on the upper right to preserve the changes made.</p>
    <p>To sort the list alphabetically, you can simply click the Sort Ascending or Sort Descending button on the bottom left of the tab view. Please note that the sorting is based on the display label. You can also reorder the items in your list, by dragging and dropping the items into the desired position.

    <h4 id="af1976-0a77-5077-2199-5606f9639088_Editing_Sales_Stages">Editing Sales Stages</h4>
    <div>
        <p>The Revenue Line Items module contains two fields that function unlike other fields in Sugar. When the Sales Stage dropdown field is updated, the corresponding probability is automatically populated in the Probability (%) field. This is a unique function to the Revenue Line Items module. These two fields use the two dropdown lists, "sales_stage_dom" and "sales_probability_dom". Both dropdown lists have the same item name for all values but different display labels. The sales_stage_dom list is associated to the Sales Stage field and displays the various sales stages (e.g. prospecting, qualification, closed won, etc.). The sales_probability_dom list is associated to the Probability (%) field and displays the corresponding probability value (e.g. 10, 20, 100, etc.) for each sales stage.</p>
        <p>When any changes are made to the sales_stage_dom list, you must consider the sales_probability_dom list as well to ensure the relationship between the two fields remain intact. For example, if you add a new sales stage (e.g. Item Name: "review_stage", Display Label: "Review Stage") to the sales_stage_dom list then you must add a corresponding probability (e.g. Item Name: "review_stage", Display Label: "50") to the sales_probability_dom list in order for it to populate properly in the revenue line item. The two lists' item names and order must match.</p>
        <p>The Opportunities module's Status field uses the sales_status_dom list . Modifying this list is not recommended as the values in this dropdown are tied to the Revenue Line Item module's Sales Stage field. Making changes to this dropdown list's item names via code or Studio can cause unexpected behavior. For more information regarding the Status field, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.6/Ent/Application_Guide/Opportunities">Opportunities</a> documentation. </p>
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: The dropdown lists "sales_stage_dom" and "sales_probability_dom" must have "Closed Won" and "Closed Lost" as item names in order for the Forecasts module to function correctly. Please ensure any changes to these lists does not remove or change the item name for these two options. </p>
        <p>For sales_stage_dom list:
            <br><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e4561ce1-abdb-6b9c-6b8b-550300031ee4.png" alt="Sales_stage_dom_list" width="400" height="230">
            <br>For sales_probability_dom list:

    <p>The "After Time Elapsed" workflow triggers after a specified period of time has elapsed from when a record save occurs in Sugar. For more information on "After Time Elapsed" workflows, please refer to the <a href="#id-65b64b62-38fb-df59-ef08-5606f953f378">Workflow Management</a> documentation. When creating the conditions for the workflow, you have the option to specify the time interval (e.g. 0 hours, 4 hours, 1 day, 1 week, etc.) used by the system to execute the workflow. The available time interval values can easily be modified via the Dropdown Editor.</p>
    <p>The Dropdown Editor contains the "tselect_time_dom" list, which allows administrators to configure the time intervals used for time elapsed workflows. To add new time intervals to the dropdown list, simply enter the "Item Name" and "Display Label", keeping in mind that the item name must display the number of seconds corresponding to the new time interval. The display label value should have the time as it relates to minutes, hours, days, etc. For example, if you are adding 2 hours to the time interval list, the item name value will be "7200" and the display label will show "2 hours".</p>

When editing a particular dropdown list, the Roles dropdown appearing on the top right contains all existing roles in the Sugar application. The Default role-list allows admins to add, remove, or reorder options within a dropdown list. By default, none of the other Sugar roles have customized lists, so changes made to the Default role-list will automatically be copied to the other role-lists upon save. This means that as long as no role-list are customized here, all users will continue to see the dropdown options and order matching the Default role-list.</p>
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: It is recommended to assign each user to a maximum of one role. Users belonging to multiple roles which each have customized role-views may experience unexpected behavior when using record views. For more information about roles, please refer to the <a href="#id-659e5065-4db0-5206-13c6-5606f994b8b6">Role Management</a> documentation.</p>
        <p>If you wish to restrict certain roles to use a modified list of options when editing records, select the desired role from the Roles dropdown to make changes specific to that role (e.g. Marketing Administrator).

        <p>When viewing a Sugar role's role-list (e.g. Marketing Administrator), you have the option to disable, enable, or reorder the existing options. Options cannot be added or deleted via any role-list except "Default". Drag and drop an option in order to change its position in the role-list's options list. To disable an option, uncheck the box on the right of the option's row. Doing so will prevent the option from appearing in the dropdown when a user belonging to this role is editing or creating a record. Once an option is disabled, it will appear greyed out with a strike-through. When the desired changes have been made, click "Save &amp; Deploy".
            <br><strong>Note</strong>: Each role's role-list must have at least one enabled option.

        <p>Once you have saved and deployed a modification to a role-list, it is considered customized and will display an asterisk (*) next to the role's name in the Roles dropdown. Reordering options on the Default role-list will no longer have any affect on customized role-lists. However, adding an option, deleting an option, or changing an option's display label on the Default role-list will add, remove, or alter the option for all role-lists including customized role-lists.

        <p><strong>Note</strong>: Users will be able to view all dropdown values regardless of role restrictions when viewing records. This means if a record has a dropdown value set to which a user has a role-based restriction, he or she will still be able to view the value.</p>
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: Role-based customizations to dropdown lists are included when exporting customizations from Studio.

<div>
    <p>Depending on your business needs, it may be necessary to alter the display label to make the module's name (e.g. Contacts, Accounts, etc.) align to your various business components. Administrators can easily rename modules via Admin &gt; Rename Modules. When editing a name, you are given the option to update both the singular and plural version of the word. This change will be reflected globally across Sugar so that every use of the given module name is updated to your preference, seamlessly to all users. You can also use the language dropdown list at the top of the page to rename the modules to a language other than English.</p>
    <p>The following steps cover renaming the Contacts module as an example:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Navigate to Admin &gt; Rename Modules.</li>
        <li>Locate the module you wish to change and click the Pencil icon to the left of the module's name.

        <li>Enter in a new singular and plural name for the module then click the Pencil icon again to close the text boxes.
