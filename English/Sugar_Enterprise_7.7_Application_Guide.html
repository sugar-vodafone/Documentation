id="e2ae4668-47e0-fc8c-0e3a-570e8a5df444_Overview">Overview</h2><p>Sugar offers users a wide range of configuration options when getting started with the application. Your first time logging into Sugar the New User Wizard will step through configuring some basic settings (i.e. Your Information, Your Locale, etc.). You may skip these steps and configure these settings in your user preferences at a later time. Please note that system administrators can also set up each user's basic settings when creating the user in Sugar. This documentation will cover the various options (e.g. New User Wizard, User Preferences, etc.) available when first getting started with Sugar and accessing your account.</p><h2 id="e2ae4668-47e0-fc8c-0e3a-570e8a5df444_Accessing_Sugar">Accessing Sugar</h2><h3 id="e2ae4668-47e0-fc8c-0e3a-570e8a5df444_Prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3><p>The following will need to be installed and configured on your local machine prior to accessing Sugar:</p><ul><li>A supported web browser application (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, etc.) is required on your local machine. For more information on the various supported web browsers, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Resources/Supported_Platforms/">Supported Platforms</a> page.</li><li>The web browser must have JavaScript and cookie support enabled in order to access Sugar.</li><li>Network access to a server running your Sugar instance is required.</li></ul><h3 id="e2ae4668-47e0-fc8c-0e3a-570e8a5df444_Logging_In">Logging In</h3><p>The Sugar login screen allows you to enter login credentials (user name and password) to access your instance. Navigate your web browser to your instance's URL (e.g. <span>https://example.sugarondemand.com</span>) to access Sugar's login screen. If you do not know your instance URL or login credentials, please reach out to your system administrator for assistance. The New User Wizard will launch upon your first successful log in to Sugar allowing you to configure some of your basic personal settings. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/29879d61-68f9-74e6-ce52-5503042ca770.png" alt="Login_Dialog" height="185" width="258" /></p><h3 id="e2ae4668-47e0-fc8c-0e3a-570e8a5df444_Resetting_Your_Password">Resetting Your Password</h3><p>There may be occasions when users forget their Sugar password and will need to reset it. If the system administrator has enabled the Forgot Password feature via Admin &gt; Password Management, users will have the option to request a password reset directly from Sugar's login screen. If you do not see the Forgot Password link on your login screen, please reach out to your system administrator for further assistance. System administrators can either enable the Forgot Password feature, send a system-generated password to the user, or manually change the user's password via Admin &gt; User Management. For more information on how to set up and manage passwords in Sugar, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Password_Management">Password Management</a> documentation. Please note that the outbound mail server for the system must be configured via Admin &gt; Email Settings and users will also need to have their <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Getting_Started/#Email_Settings">personal email settings</a> configured in their user preferences in order for the temporary password information to be emailed.For more information on setting up the system email settings, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Email">Email</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p><p>Use the following steps to request a new password:</p><ol><li>Click the Forgot Password? link on the bottom left of Sugar's login dialog box. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/82f53486-9b96-6af5-cb43-550304056509.png" alt="LoggingIn_ForgotPassword" height="186" width="258" /></li><li>Enter your Sugar username and primary email address on file, then click "Request Password".

The Language dropdown list will appear allowing you to select the appropriate language you want displayed in your Sugar account. The out-of-the-box default language is English (US), but administrators can change the default language globally via Admin &gt; Locale. For more information on configuring the default language in Sugar, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/System">User Interface</a> section of the System documentation. Once the default language is changed by the administrator, it will display as the default selection on the login screen for all users.</p><p>Administrators can also control what languages are available to select in the Language dropdown list via Admin &gt; Languages. If you do not see one of the listed languages below displayed in the Language dropdown list, please reach out to your system administrator for assistance.

This will log you out completely from Sugar and you must <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Getting_Started/#Logging_In">log in</a> again in order to access your account.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5091d1f2-48a5-3323-6fb0-550304ecb435.png" alt="LogOut_Option" height="167" width="145" /></p><h4 id="e2ae4668-47e0-fc8c-0e3a-570e8a5df444_Automatic_Log_Outs">Automatic Log Outs</h4><p>While working in Sugar, a user may be automatically logged out of the system. Currently, Sugar allows a username to be logged in under only one session, and any additional user sessions started using the same username will log out the previous session. This behavior is for your security as Sugar does not allow multiple sessions for the same username from different machines or browsers. To prevent situations like this, please do not share your login credentials (username and password) with users in your organization.</p><p>Another situation where users are automatically logged out is when the user does not perform any actions in Sugar for a certain period of time. The security timeout period in Sugar is controlled by configuration settings in PHP and the web server running your Sugar instance. Please note that the PHP session's lifetime persists until you close your web browser and the default session timeout value is 1440 seconds (24 minutes).</p><p>In order to prevent security timeouts, users can navigate or click the page(s) in Sugar every so often to keep the session active. If the session times out, click any button, tab, etc. on the current page once you are ready to continue working in Sugar, and you will be taken back to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Getting_Started/#Logging_In">Login screen</a>. Another option is to completely close your current browser and open a new browser to navigate back to Sugar's Login page.</p><p>Please note that users can have multiple tabs of Sugar pages open within the same web browser (e.g. Chrome) without getting logged out of the system. For example, this is useful when working with multiple Sugar pages or records without navigating away from previous pages.</p><h2 id="e2ae4668-47e0-fc8c-0e3a-570e8a5df444_New_User_Wizard">New User Wizard</h2><p>When users first log in to Sugar, they will step through the New User Wizard to configure some basic settings (i.e. Your Information, Your Locale, etc.). If the system administrator already configured your basic settings when adding you as a user to Sugar, the fields in the wizard will be populated with the provided information. You can update your information as you go through the New User Wizard to make any necessary changes. Please note that you can skip the steps in the wizard if you wish to configure the settings via your user preferences at a later time.</p><h3 id="e2ae4668-47e0-fc8c-0e3a-570e8a5df444_Configuring_Your_Information">Configuring Your Information</h3><p>The Your Information step of the New User Wizard allows you to enter basic information (e.g. name, email address, phone) about yourself to be stored in your user profile. Please note that the information provided in this step can be updated in your user preferences at a later time if desired. For more information on configuring your personal information, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Getting_Started/#User_Preferences">User Preferences</a> section of this documentation.</p><p>The following options are available to configure your user profile:</p><ul><li><strong>First Name</strong> : Enter your first name.</li><li><strong>Last Name </strong>: Enter your last name.</li><li><strong>Email</strong> : Enter your primary email address.</li><li><strong>Phone</strong> : Enter your office number.</li></ul><p>Please note that all required fields will indicate "Required" in the field and must be completed prior to moving to the next step of the wizard.

Roles work in conjunction with teams to form a robust security model for non-admin users in Sugar. Roles control three different layers of access for users within Sugar: module, field, and action-level access. Please note that only users who are assigned to the specific role will be able to perform actions (e.g. view, edit, delete, etc.) defined by it. For more information on the various actions and setting options for roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Getting_Started/#Access_Table">Access Table</a> section of this documentation. Users who are not assigned to a role can access and perform actions in any module as long as they are assigned to the record or a member of the team assigned to manage it. System administrators have the ability to create various roles and assign additional roles to users via Admin &gt; Role Management. For more information on creating and assigning roles, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation.</p><p>The Roles section displays the list of roles (if any) assigned to the user. Please note that if you are assigned to more than one role, the more restrictive role setting prevails. For example, if you have two roles where one role allows exporting of records in the Leads module and the other does not, then you will not be able to export lead records due to the more restrictive role setting.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/bdcade4f-f1b4-2ae8-d429-550304e36ca4.png" alt="Roles" height="100" width="304" /></p><h4 id="e2ae4668-47e0-fc8c-0e3a-570e8a5df444_My_Teams">My Teams</h4><p>Teams consist of one or more users who are assigned to manage records in Sugar. The defined permissions determine what records a user is and is not able to access. Teams are used in conjunction with roles to form a robust security model for non-admin users in Sugar. The My Teams section displays the list of teams a user is associated with, which determines what records the user has access to in Sugar. Please note that every record is assigned to at least one team, but can be assigned to multiple teams as well if different users need access to it. The default team(s) set in the User Settings section under the Advanced tab will automatically be assigned to new records created by the user. Users assigned to the record, as well as system administrators can access the record regardless of team membership. When a user is created in Sugar, they are automatically associated with the Global team (universal team) and a Private team (users own personal team) is created by default. System administrators can assign users to additional teams via Admin &gt; User Management or Admin &gt; Team Management as necessary.

Matching records will be displayed in the list view below. Global search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database rather than restricting search to a specific module. In both searches, Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %services). This will pull up any record that has the word "services" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p><h3 id="e2afa4fc-53b1-98fd-a13d-570e8a34b0b5_Global_Search_2">Global Search</h3><p>For a brief introduction to global search, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/User_Interface/#Global_Search">Global Search</a> section of this page. For in-depth information on both search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Search">Search</a> documentation.</p><h3 id="e2afa4fc-53b1-98fd-a13d-570e8a34b0b5_List_View_Search">List View Search</h3><p>List view search enables users to easily search by the record's name within an individual module and pull up matching records in the list view. The search also provides a Filter option allowing you to narrow your search further using the available options as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Create</strong> : Create a new custom filter which you can use to filter your search <ul><li><strong>Note</strong>: You can also click "Create" to the right of the Filter option.</li></ul></li><li><strong>All "Module Name"</strong> : Returns all records in the module (e.g. Accounts) to which you have access</li><li><strong>My "Module Name" </strong>: Returns only records assigned to you</li><li><strong>My Favorites</strong> : Returns only records you have marked as favorites</li><li><strong>Recently Created </strong>: Returns only records you created in the module within the last 7 days</li><li><strong>Recently Viewed </strong>: Returns only records you have viewed in the module within the last 7 days</li></ul><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/f33eed02-c1be-babe-eef8-564292e61a7d.png" alt="accounts modulesearch-tiny" width="460" height="273" /></p><p>When you choose a filter, Sugar will return record's which match both the selected filter and any name provided in the open Search box in the filtered list view results. For example, if you select "My Accounts" in the Filter options and enter an account name, Sugar will only return account records with a matching name that are assigned to you. Once the search is complete, the relevant results will populate in the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/User_Interface/#List_View">list view</a> below the search bar. To see all account records to which you have access, simply select the All Accounts option in the filter and remove any text from the search bar. You can also click the Clear icon within the selected filter option (e.g. My Accounts) in the Search bar to clear the filter and pull up all list view search results. When you run a search using a saved or created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. In addition, searches using the open Search box only or in combination with advanced filters (e.g. My Favorites) are preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/cef561a9-bcce-a0f6-3ba6-564292781040.png" alt="accounts search clear-tiny" width="277" height="153" /></p><p>Please note that you will only be able to see records as allowed by your team membership, user access type, and assigned roles.

This allows users to add custom, complex filter options when searching in the module's list view. You have the option to add multiple fields to your new filter by clicking the Plus button to the right of the filter selection dropdown lists and set select operators along with their value(s). A filter's criteria need to be true for a record in order for it to appear in the list view search result.

You can create a related record as well as link an existing record directly from the subpanel. Once the records appear within the subpanel, users can <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/User_Interface/#Viewing_Via_Preview">preview</a> the record's detail and edit the record's data directly from the record view.

Each relationship between two modules has a type, and that type determines if the relationship produces a field or a subpanel for each side. When a record of the primary module can be related to only one record of a second module (i.e. 1-1 or M-1 relationships), the relationship is displayed as a field on the primary module. When the record can be related to multiple records of a second module (i.e. 1-M or M-M relationships), the relationship is displayed as a subpanel instead since subpanels can hold many records. For example, an account may be related to multiple contacts, so the related contacts are displayed in a subpanel on the account record. Administrators or users with developer-level role access have the ability to change a subpanel's title and included fields by configuring the layout via Admin &gt; Studio to provide visibility to the most important fields. For more information on modifying subpanels, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Developer_Tools/Studio">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration Guide.</p><p>Some modules include other kinds of subpanels such as the Emails or Campaign Log subpanels. For information about these, please refer to the individual module's documentation.</p><p>Related record subpanels allow the following operations to be performed:</p><ul><li><strong>Record Count</strong> : Subpanel headers display the total count of related records (e.g. "5 of 6+") next to the module name. The count captures the number of records currently displayed with an additional, hyperlinked number (e.g. "6+") where there are more records than currently displayed. Click the hyperlinked number to see the total count of related records.</li><li><strong>Collapse or Expand</strong> : Click anywhere in the subpanel's header to collapse or expand it. Subpanels will remain collapsed or expanded on future visits to the module. <ul><li><strong>Note</strong>: Administrators can choose to disable the sticky feature and collapse all subpanels by default via Admin &gt; System Settings. For more information, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/System">System</a> documentation in the Administration Guide.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Column Widths</strong> : Place your cursor on the column divider and, when the double arrow cursor appears, click and drag the column to the desired size. Please note that the column width will not be preserved when you navigate away from the page. <ul><li><strong>Note</strong>: Sugar enforces a minimum width for currency fields in list view columns which prevents the columns from being collapsed beyond this limit.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Column Sort</strong> : Click a column header to sort the subpanel's items by that value. Clicking the same header again will reverse the sorting order (e.g. from ascending to descending).</li><li><strong>Create a New Linked Record</strong> : Click the Plus button on the upper right of a subpanel to relate a new record to the record you are currently viewing. Please note that the Link Existing Record option is not available when the relationship is required in the related module (e.g. in an account's Opportunities subpanel). <ul><li><strong>Note</strong>: Because creating a new related record opens a drawer on top of the current record view, you should use the Cancel button to return to record view. Using the browser's back button will return you to the previous page.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Link Existing Record</strong> : Click the triangle to the right of the Plus button then select "Link Existing Record" to relate existing records to the record you are currently viewing. <ul><li><strong>Note</strong>: Because linking an existing record opens a drawer on top of the current record view, you should use the Cancel button to return to record view. Using the browser's back button will return you to the previous page.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Favorites Designation</strong> : Click the star on the left of a record's row to toggle it as a favorite. A dark grey star indicates that the record is a favorite while a white star indicates it is not. For more information, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/User_Interface/#Favoriting_Records">Favoriting Records</a> section of this page.</li><li><strong>Hyperlink Fields</strong> : Blue field values, such as record names, may be clicked to open the record in record view.

Users have the ability to search for records which appear in the subpanels as well as filter the view to only display a specific module (e.g. Leads, Contacts, etc.). To locate a record by name, enter the keyword into the Search bar, and the subpanel(s) with the matching record(s) will appear below.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e0216e8b-1906-1420-ba91-5644c56d6fc0.png" alt="related-subpanel-search" width="500" height="142" /></p><p>To filter, simply click the Related option to the far left of the Search bar and select the module whose subpanel you wish to view. Filter and search may be combined to only display matching records within a selected module. To see all subpanels to which you have access, simply select "All" in the Related options and remove any text from the search bar. When you run a search using a saved or created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the page. Returning to the page will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that search strings entered in the open Search box are not preserved when navigating away.</p><p>When a Sidecar module (e.g. Contacts, Leads, Tasks, etc.) is selected from the Related options, you have the option to filter the related subpanels further using one of the available options (e.g. My Favorites, Recently Created, etc.). Please note that you can also create custom filters for related Sidecar modules. Once the related module (e.g. Contacts) is selected, either click the Filter option and select "Create" or click "Create" to the right of the Filter option.

While many fields are available for use on each module out-of-the-box, administrators and users with developer-level role access have the ability to add fields of these various types to modules via Admin &gt; Studio as described in the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Developer_Tools/Studio">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration Guide. Studio may also be used to configure fields by, for example, making fields required, allowing them to be mass updated, making their values calculated, and specifying when they should be visible.</p><p>Descriptions and instructions for editing different field types are available below:</p><ul><li><strong>Text </strong>: Text fields allow users to enter a word or brief phrase by clicking into the field and typing. Text fields will accept any combination of characters (i.e. letters, numbers, spaces, and symbols) but have a 100-character limit by default. Administrators can edit the maximum character length restriction via Admin &gt; Studio.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8b965219-35d8-7ef8-143c-5644ca1d2fc9.png" alt="text-field77" width="400" height="46" /></li><li><strong>Text Area</strong> : Text area fields allow users to enter large amounts of text by clicking into the field and typing. Administrators can modify the default display size of a text area field via Admin &gt; Studio, but this will not limit the number of characters that can be entered by a user. Most browsers supported by Sugar will allow the user to resize an active text area field temporarily by dragging the bottom corner of the field to the desired width and height.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/51fdf92a-f4e7-e1e1-af28-5644ca44120a.png" alt="textarea-field77" width="400" height="117" /></li><li><strong>Integer</strong> : Integer fields allow users to enter whole number values (e.g. 850) by clicking into the field and typing. Administrators can specify a minimum and maximum value for the field via Admin &gt; Studio. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b093a7c8-9326-b8c3-ff98-550286da2712.png" alt="Integer_Field" width="270" height="49" /></li><li><strong>Dropdown</strong> : Dropdown fields provide a list of values where only one value can be selected at a time. The list will be collapsed to only display the selected value except during editing, making it appropriate for longer lists of values. Click the selected value to see the full list. Clicking the desired value will replace it as the selected value.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/ded8d4a7-8057-7eeb-293e-5502861a7d46.png" alt="Dropdown_Field" width="289" height="249" /></li><li><strong>Multiselect</strong> : Multiselect fields provide a list of values where one or more values can be selected at a time.

Click the blank space to the right of selected values to see additional options. Click the x on a selected value to de-select it.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8777f5d9-3689-dde8-e7e7-550286ab65c6.png" alt="Multiselect_Field" width="281" height="214" /></li><li><strong>Radio</strong> : Radio fields provide a list of values where only one value can be selected at a time. The entire list of all values will be displayed at all times, making it appropriate for shorter lists of values. Click the circle of the desired value, and any previously selected value will be de-selected automatically. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/72408adf-0fda-8aaf-6ea8-550286fe23f9.png" alt="Radio_Field" height="103" width="158" /></li><li><strong>Checkbox</strong> : Checkbox fields provide a boolean type typically used to answer a yes or no question. Click the box to toggle whether it is checked or not.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/26f309e6-9b9e-3d52-1cc5-55028671f83e.png" alt="Checkbox_Field" width="166" height="64" /></li><li><strong>Date</strong> : Date fields allow users to specify a particular date by either typing a date in the provided format or clicking the Calendar icon and selecting it via the date picker. Click the month and year (e.g. "October 2013") to select the desired month or use the arrows to navigate to the desired month.

The module selector works like a dropdown field while the record selector works like a relate field, both of which are described above. Please note that a module may only have one flex relate field.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e00400b0-3941-1203-64f8-564514fe1b51.png" alt="flex-relate-77" width="300" height="275" /></li><li><strong>Email Address</strong> : Email address fields contain one or more email addresses for a single record; email addresses are entered by clicking in the field and typing or pasting the address. The following options are available when editing an Email Address field: <ul><li><strong>Add/Remove email</strong> : Add additional email address fields by clicking the plus button. Click the minus button to remove the adjacent address.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e60a767e-cbef-7cf0-2ac7-56450a36816f.png" alt="email-addremove-77" width="300" height="69" /></li><li><strong>Primary</strong> : A white star with a black background represents the primary email address on a record. This will be the default address that Sugar will find when the record is included in email campaigns and other send-message events performed within the application. On a given record, only one email address can be the primary one. If a record contains only one email address, it will be set to primary by default.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/3ee20b93-713f-b485-602f-56450a8663f9.png" alt="email-primary-77" width="300" height="42" /></li><li><strong>Opted Out</strong> : The button with a slashed circle indicates whether or not an email address has been opted out from email marketing campaigns. Sugar automatically enables the corresponding Opt-Out button when a recipient clicks the opt-out link in an email message sent through Sugar's Campaigns module. When enabled, the button will have a black background. Users may also manually enable this button to exclude the email address from future email campaigns. For more information about opt-outs and campaigns, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Campaigns">Campaigns</a> documentation in the Application guide.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a9d1fe4f-d3d3-ac2b-406d-56450e86971a.png" alt="email-optout-77" width="300" height="38" /></li><li><strong>Invalid</strong> : Invalid or undeliverable email addresses are represented by a black button with a white exclamation point. Sugar automatically marks email addresses as invalid if they are returned via the recipient's mail server during the distribution of an email campaign. Users can also manually toggle the invalid designation on and off by clicking the Invalid button next to the email address. Sugar will not permit users to send messages to invalid email addresses from anywhere within the application.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/c2b0e3b0-c87b-6ed1-4509-56450a9efc46.png" alt="email-invalid-77" width="300" height="39" /></li></ul></li><li><strong>Teams</strong> : The Teams field specifies which teams of users have access to view the record. An individual team selection works like a dropdown field which is described above. Click the Plus button to add additional teams to the record or the Minus button to remove a team. Click the Star button to set the primary team. For more information on teams, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Team_Management">Team Management</a> documentation in the Administration Guide.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/6bf709b2-31ad-7912-3c44-5502861c792b.png" alt="Teams_Field" width="295" height="104" /></li><li><b>Tags</b> : The Tags field allows users to enter keywords or phrases in order to connect Sugar records by common attributes that may not be defined via basic database fields.

For example, a meeting with a status of "Planned" will appear in the Activities subpanel. Once the meeting is changed to a status of "Held", it will move from the Activities subpanel to the History subpanel. All related note and email records will appear in the History subpanel as there are no filters on those modules, but notes and emails will never display in the Activities subpanel. If you customize the status field for any of the modules, the records that hold a custom status will appear in the Activities subpanel. But code level customizations would be required to have a new status show in the History subpanels. <br /> Please refer to this chart for the criteria both subpanels use to query data:</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Subpanel</strong></td><td><strong>Module</strong></td><td><strong>Status Field Filter</strong></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="6"><p>Activities</p></td><td rowspan="2">Meetings</td><td>Does not Equal "Held"</td></tr><tr><td>Does not Equal "Not Held"</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Tasks</td><td>Does not Equal "Completed"</td></tr><tr><td>Does not Equal "Deferred"</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Calls</td><td>Does not Equal "Held"</td></tr><tr><td>Does not Equal "Not Held"</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="8">History</td><td rowspan="2">Meetings</td><td>Equals "Held"</td></tr><tr><td>Equals "Not Held"</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Tasks</td><td>Equals "Completed"</td></tr><tr><td>Equals "Deferred"</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Calls</td><td>Equals "Held"</td></tr><tr><td>Equals "Not Held"</td></tr><tr><td>Emails</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Notes</td><td>N/A</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Since the Activities and History subpanels contain records from many different modules, there are some differences in the actions and record display than in normal subpanels. Each record in both subpanels will have an icon to the far left indicating which module the record originates from. For example, if the record is a call then the Telephone icon will display to the left of the subject. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/7b97d2da-b2cf-3ba5-d3be-55028d7dd35c.png" alt="Detail_View_Subpanels_Activities_Icons" width="320" height="418" /></p><p>Normal subpanels typically have a Create and Select option to create or link related records. The Activities and History subpanels have multiple actions due to the fact that there are multiple modules involved. <br /> You have the following actions available from the Activities subpanel:</p><ul><li><strong>Create Task</strong> : Creates a new task record related to the record currently being viewed.</li><li><strong>Schedule Meeting</strong> : Creates a new meeting record related to the record currently being viewed.</li><li><strong>Log Call</strong> : Creates a new call record related to the record currently being viewed.</li><li><strong>Compose Email</strong> : Launches the Compose Email popup window to send an email. <ul><li><strong>Note</strong>: The email will automatically be related to the current record (e.g. Quotes) you are viewing.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: When creating a Task, Meeting, or Call from the Activities subpanel, you have the ability to set the Status field to "Held" or "Completed" which will place it in the History subpanel. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/39a32fc1-76a3-3d0d-70d2-55028d9c0d8b.png" alt="Detail_View_Subpanels_Activities_Actions" width="340" height="171" /></p><p>You have the following actions available from the History subpanel:</p><ul><li><strong>Create Note or Attachment</strong> : Creates a new note record related to the record currently being viewed.</li><li><strong>Archive Email</strong> : Allows a received email to be entered manually on a record for historical purposes only. <ul><li><strong>Note</strong>: This will not send an email to you or the email address on the record.</li></ul></li><li><strong>View Summary</strong> : Opens a popup window with the Subject, Status, and Detail of all associated records in the History subpanel.

By default, there are stock dashlets that come out-of-the-box with Sugar and users can easily add them to various dashboards per their viewing preference. Please note that each dashlet can be configured to display the necessary information you wish to view. For more information on configuring the dashlet, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/User_Interface/Intelligence_Pane/#Editing_Dashlets">Editing Dashlets</a> section of this documentation.</p><h3 id="e2b70041-10bb-d810-f718-570e8aafd0db_Commonly_Used_Dashlets">Commonly Used Dashlets</h3><p>By default, the intelligence pane's "My Dashboard" will include some stock dashlets such as "History", "Planned Activities", etc. Users have the option to add additional dashlets as they wish to the intelligence pane. For more information on adding dashlets, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/User_Interface/Intelligence_Pane/#Adding_Dashlets">Adding Dashlets</a> section of this documentation. Please note that the dashlets (e.g. Opportunity Metrics, Cases Summary, etc.) available to view and add will vary between the modules in Sugar. The following sections will go over some commonly used dashlets which can be viewed and managed via the dashboard.</p><h4 id="e2b70041-10bb-d810-f718-570e8aafd0db_List_View_Dashlet">List View Dashlet</h4><p>The List View dashlet enables users to view a list of records for a specific module (e.g. Accounts, Contacts, Leads, etc.) in Sugar. When configuring the dashlet, simply select the primary module (e.g. Accounts, Contacts, Leads, etc.) you wish to view a list of records for along with the filters (e.g. columns, display rows, etc.) you wish to apply. Please note that the dashlet title (e.g. My Accounts, My Contacts, etc.) will vary based on the primary module selected when adding the dashlet. Certain modules (Accounts, Contacts, Leads, etc.) in Sugar display the List View dashlet by default in their list view's intelligence pane. For example, if you navigate to the Contacts list view, the My Accounts dashlet will appear in the intelligence pane dashboard.</p><p>Once added, you can <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/User_Interface/Intelligence_Pane/#Configuration_Options">configure</a> the dashlet as necessary by clicking the Gear icon on the upper right if you wish to change the designated module for the dashlet, apply pre-defined or custom filters, etc. Please note that any changes made by the administrator to the List View layout in Studio affects the list of available fields in the module's list view dashlet layout. The deployed changes will not display automatically in the corresponding module dashlet and users will need to edit the dashlet in order to view the changes in the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/User_Interface/Intelligence_Pane/#Configuration_Options">Columns</a> field , add new fields to the layout, etc. For more information on editing the List View layout in Studio, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Developer_Tools/Studio">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration Guide.</p><p>When viewing the List View dashlet, the first set of records meeting the filter criteria will be displayed, and you can click the More link (e.g. More accounts) at the bottom of the dashlet to display additional records. The number of records that load each time you click the link depends on the display row number (5, 10, 15, 20) selected in the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/User_Interface/Intelligence_Pane/#Configuration_Options">C</a><a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/User_Interface/Intelligence_Pane/#Configuration_Options">onfiguration Options</a> page . Simply scroll down the dashlet list view to view all records that are loaded. Please note that dashlets set to display 5 rows will show the dashlet's height increasing slightly when initially clicking the More "Module" link to display more records at once. Any subsequent clicks on the link will load the next set of results and be viewable by scrolling. The More link will no longer appear once all records meeting the dashlet's filter criteria are loaded in the dashlet list view results.</p><p>Multiple List View dashlets can be added to the intelligence pane as well if you wish to view the list of records for various modules.

You can use the wildcard character (% or *) at the beginning or end of your text when entering in the account name to broaden the search if you wish. Please note that the search results are based on matching company names as well as the trade style names associated to the company in the D&amp;B database.

Please note that the first ten matching companies will display in the D&amp;B Account Create dashlet, and you can click "Show More D&amp;B Search Results" at the bottom of the dashlet to display the other companies. The company's headquarters, subsidiary companies, and branches will be identified accordingly within the dashlet. Please note that any companies detected as a duplicate of an existing Sugar account, will be marked as "Duplicate" in red to the right of the company's name in the search result. The duplicate check is based on the DUNS number, which is a unique company ID populated in the account's record view when data is imported from D&amp;B. In addition, if an existing account does not have a DUNS number but has a matching name, a duplicate check is performed in Sugar upon saving the new account to pull up any matching accounts.</p><p>Select the appropriate company in the search results list and the company's key information (e.g. name, phone, address, etc.) will display in the D&amp;B: Company Information dashlet.

Select the appropriate company you wish to view and the company's key information (e.g. name, phone, address, etc.) will display in the D&amp;B: Family Tree dashlet. To return back to the previous view, simply click "Back To D&amp;B Family Tree" at the bottom of the dashlet. To import the company into Sugar, simply click the Import button on the upper right of the dashlet to create the new account record. Please note that the company may be detected as a duplicate of an existing Sugar account if the name matches that of an organization (e.g. SugarCRM Inc.) in the family tree that has already been imported. The duplicate record(s) (if any) will appear within the record view, but you can click "Ignore Duplicate and Save" if you wish to proceed with creating the record. Please note that you can preview the duplicate record(s) as well as edit the record as you wish before saving. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/3fd4b42b-7710-184d-ece6-5503043edb7b.png" alt="AccountsRecordView_DB_FamilyTree_New" width="371" height="234" /></p><h5 id="e2b70041-10bb-d810-f718-570e8aafd0db_DB_Industry_Information_Dashlet">D&amp;B: Industry Information Dashlet</h5><p>The D&amp;B: Industry Information dashlet is available for the Standard and Premium D&amp;B license types and provides information such as the company's industry overview, business challenges, executive insight, etc. In addition, the industry information (e.g. Business Challenges, Call Preparation Questions, etc.) provided in the dashlet varies between the Standard and Premium license agreement.

Users can perform a search via the module's list view, record view, as well as global search. The module search allows you to locate records easily and effectively in a module-specific manner. Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the module list view or subpanel view of the record. Global search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. This documentation will go over the basics of the various search options and cover how to perform a search, filter a search, view results, etc.</p><h2 id="e2ba1644-b986-eb10-8933-570e8a3ecc9b_Global_Search">Global Search</h2><p>Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting searches to a specific module. The Global Search bar displays on the upper right of every Sugar page and utilizes Full Text Search to search throughout nearly all fields and modules for an enhanced search experience. For more information on performing searches within a single module, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Search/#List_View_Search_Sidecar_Modules">List View Search</a> and <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Search/#Record_View_Search_Sidecar_Modules">Record View Search</a> section of this documentation.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/3c10d5ca-b4b9-9dc2-be23-55674add90f9.png" alt="GlobalSearch Bar7.7 2" width="503" height="40" /></p><p>By default, Sugar comes out-of-the-box with a defined list of fields for each module that users can search as well as view in the search results on the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Search/#Viewing_All_Results">View All Results</a> page. Please note that secondary fields (e.g. email address, office phone, start date, etc.) will display in the View All Results page only if they contain a value. In addition, if there is a match found in a searchable field, it will display on the View All Results page even though it is not defined as a displayed field for the module. For example, if you enter a search (e.g. John) and the system finds a match in the case's Description field, but the Description field is not configured in the record view layout for cases, the case record will appear on the View All Results page along with the description as the secondary field because it contains the search term.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: All email addresses (e.g. primary, secondary) in the record are included in search.

Administrators can control additional elements of global search via Admin &gt; Search and Admin &gt; Studio. If the administrator globally disables a module for search, you will not be able to perform a search on that module or filter by that module when searching. For more information on how to enable and disable certain fields and modules in Global Search, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Developer_Tools/Studio">Studio</a> documentation as well as the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/System">Search </a>section of the System documentation in the Administration guide.</p><p>To use global search, you need to first enter the keyword (e.g. abc) into the search box and the pop-up results will begin appearing once you enter in at least one character. Please note that clicking into the search bar will expand it across Sugar's navigation bar, which spans across the top of the screen. To minimize the search bar, simply click anywhere outside of the search bar or hit the Esc key on your keyboard.</p><p>Once expanded, you will be able to access the Module dropdown by clicking the down arrow on the far left of the search box. This allows you to configure some aspects of global search such as what module(s) (e.g. Accounts, Contacts, etc.) to filter your search results by in Sugar. If you wish to clear your search term, simply click the X icon to the far right of the search box. Please note that this will collapse the search bar as well.</p><p>By default, up to five search results will display below the search box and include the primary field (e.g. name, subject) for the records matching your search term. The specific term (e.g. abc) in the record's field is bolded to indicate the match to the search term. In addition, if any secondary fields (e.g. office phone, description, etc.) match the search term as well, it will display beneath the record's primary field in the Quick Search Results list, with the matching term bolded. For any email addresses that include the matching search term, the entire email address (e.g. support@abc.com) will be bolded instead. Please note that the Quick Search Results list will display up to three matching fields for the record. To view all matching results, simply hit the Enter key while focused on the search bar or click the View all results link at the bottom of the Quick Search results list and you will be navigated to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Search/#Viewing_All_Results">View All Results</a> page. Click the appropriate record (e.g. ABC Family Associates) in the Quick Search Results list to access the record's details. Please note that users assigned a role restricting view access to a module (e.g. Cases), will not be able to view search results specific to that module.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/4f629f59-32ae-f642-4687-56f02c9ff88b.png" alt="GlobalSearch Bar Expanded4 7.7" width="589" height="317" /></p><p>You can also perform tag searches using Global Search to easily locate groups of records that are tagged by common attributes. For more information regarding tagging records, please refer to the <a href="http://dock.sugarcrm.net/dock/cache/preview/02_Documentation/Beta/Sugar_7.7.0.0_Beta/Application_Guide/Tags">Tags</a> documentation. For example, if you have a set of leads that were acquired from a specific conference (e.g. 2015 Western Conference) and you wish to locate all the lead records tagged with this value, you can perform a search using the tag value. As you search, the list of matching tags will appear in the tag ribbon beneath the search box and display up to five tags matching the search term.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e8671626-d3cc-496b-1c00-55676a26e571.png" alt="GlobalSearch TagRibbon2 7.7" width="700" height="52" /></p><p>Simply select the appropriate tag (e.g. 2015 Western Conference) from the tag ribbon and the tag pill will get entered into the search box. If you wish to remove any selected tag pills from the search box, simply click the "x" to the right of the tag name. All matching records tagged with "2015 Western Conference" will display beneath the search box.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a9e9b6b8-67eb-0300-ff96-55af61057cd1.png" alt="GlobalSearch Tag MatchingResults4 7.7" width="433" height="264" /></p><p>You can append additional search terms or tags in the search box if you wish to further narrow your search. Simply enter the keyword (e.g. Jeanette) to the right of the existing search term and the matching result(s) will display. If you search using multiple tags, the system will look for records that match any one of the tags in the search box using the "or" operator. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/baf93556-ada7-e39b-67a1-55af638e6286.png" alt="GlobalSearch Tag AppendSearchTerm MatchingResults4 7.7" width="465" height="93" /></p><p>Please note that clicking the tag pill in the module's record view or the record's preview in the intelligence pane will navigate you to the View All Results page which will display the list of records that contain the same tag. When viewing the module's list view, dashlet list view, or subpanel list view, you can click the tag link to be navigated to the View All Results page.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: You cannot click the tag pill when editing the record to access the View All Results page.</p><h3 id="e2ba1644-b986-eb10-8933-570e8a3ecc9b_OR_Operator">OR Operator</h3><p>Global Search uses the "or" operator by default when multiple keywords are entered in the search box. For example, if you enter "Jenny Smith" into the search box, Sugar will look for records that match "Jenny" or "Smith". If there is a match found in a record's secondary field (e.g. email address), the record will appear on the Quick Search Results list as well. So, if Martha Jones has an email address of "smith@example.com", then Martha Jones will be included in the search results.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/614d0203-bb95-4670-dffd-55af6ba2f3b9.png" alt="GlobalSearch OR Operator2 7.7" width="515" height="312" /></p><h3 id="e2ba1644-b986-eb10-8933-570e8a3ecc9b_Viewing_All_Results">Viewing All Results</h3><p>If there are more than five matching results, you can click on "View all results" at the bottom of the Quick Search Results list to view all matching records. The View All Results page loads an initial number of records meeting the current search criteria with the option to show additional results at the user's request. The total number of matching search results will display on the upper left of the page. By default, Sugar displays 20 records for each search results set on the View All Results page, but Administrators can change the number of records displayed via Admin &gt; System Settings. For more information on changing the number of displayed records, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/System">System</a> documentation in the Administration guide. To load the next set of Global Search results, simply click on "More search results" at the bottom of the View All Results page.</p><p>If you wish to view the full details of a record, click the record's name to open the record view (or detail view for Legacy modules). You can also view a record's (e.g. Targets) details directly from the View All Results page by clicking the Preview icon to the far right of a record's row. Please note that preview is only available for modules (e.g. Contacts, Leads, etc.) using the Sidecar user interface. The record's details will display in the intelligence pane to the right of the View All Results page and will provide users with key information regarding the record as well as any related activity stream information. For more information on previewing via the intelligence pane, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/User_Interface/Intelligence_Pane">Intelligence Pane</a> documentation. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/13ae19e8-1188-b888-6c29-55b00b37648a.png" alt="GlobalSearch ViewAllResultsPage2" width="700" height="500" /></p><h4 id="e2ba1644-b986-eb10-8933-570e8a3ecc9b_Filtering_the_View_All_Results_Page">Filtering the View All Results Page</h4><p>When not in preview mode, the intelligence pane to the right of the search results displays various Filter options (e.g. Assigned to Me, Created by Me, etc.) that allow you to further narrow the search results on the View All Results page. Please note that the filters only apply to the set of search results based on your current search query.</p><p>Each of the filter options displays a number in parentheses to indicate the number of records from the View All Results page that meet the criteria. Any filter option (e.g. My Favorites) that displays a zero count will not be clickable as there are no records that meet the criteria. As you select filter options, the search results on the page will dynamically change to only display records meeting the currently applied filter(s). In addition, the counts for all of the filter options will dynamically change to indicate the total count of records that meet the currently selected filter(s). For example, if you select "Leads" under the Modules filter, the counts next to each of the other filter options (e.g. Created By Me, Modified by Me, etc.) will change according to the number of results which are both a lead and match the particular filter (e.g. Created By Me).<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/6f1c23c3-80b4-c34a-3ddd-55b01ad9ca8d.png" alt="GlobalSearch ViewAllResultsPage FiltersApplied3" width="700" height="436" /></p><p>Selecting multiple filter options within a single filter (e.g. Modules) will use an "or" operator. So if you select "Leads" and "Contacts" from the Modules filter, the View All Results page will display both lead and contact records. However, if you select filter options from different filters, it will use an "and" operator. For example, if you select "Leads" from the Modules filter and select "Created by Me", Sugar will only return lead records that you created.</p><p>To clear individual filters, click the filter again (e.g. Created by Me) to unselect the option. If you wish to clear all filters applied on the View All Results page, simply click the Reset button on the upper right of the intelligence pane.</p><p>To collapse a multi-option filter (e.g. Modules), you can click the Up arrow on the upper right of the filter. If you wish to collapse all multi-option filters (e.g. Modules) on the intelligence pane, click the Actions menu to the right of the Reset button and select "Close All". To expand them, simply click the Actions menu again and select "Open All".</p><h3 id="e2ba1644-b986-eb10-8933-570e8a3ecc9b_Filtering_by_Module">Filtering by Module</h3><p>Global Search gives you the option to filter the search results by module by clicking the down arrow to the far left of the expanded search bar. Please note that the Search all option is selected by default to include all modules when searching. The list of available modules to select will appear in the Modules list and you can simply select the appropriate module(s) you wish to include in your search. For example, if you select the Contacts module then enter "john" in the search box, Sugar will only return matching contact records.</p><p>When three or fewer modules are selected from the Modules dropdown, the corresponding Module icons will display in the search bar. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/cde9dae7-4a24-9e55-390f-55ef550eef69.png" alt="GlobalSearch Bar ModuleIcons1 7.7" width="256" height="44" /></p><p>However, if more than three modules are selected, it will display the Multiple Modules icon in the search bar. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/1a532239-1586-a347-06a8-555a9c189c05.png" alt="GlobalSearch Bar MultipleModules 7.7" width="251" height="39" /></p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The selected module(s) will remain in the search bar until the user's browser cache is cleared.</p><p>If you wish to unselect all modules at once, simply select the Search all option from the Modules dropdown.

Please note that disabled modules will not be included in search results nor in the list of modules to filter. For more information on how to enable and disable modules for Global Search, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/System">Search</a> section of the System documentation in the Administration guide.</p><p>Administrators also have the ability to enable and disable specific fields for Global Search, as well as set the priority for searchable fields using boost values. To configure fields for search, simply navigate to Admin &gt; Studio and update the Full Text Searchable option to either "Searchable" or "Disabled" depending on whether you want it included for search or not. Boosting is the process of enhancing the relevancy of a record's fields for global search. Fields with a higher boost level will be given greater weight when the search is performed. When a search is performed, matching records containing fields with a greater weight will appear higher in the search results. The default boost value is 1.0 which stands for a neutral boost. To apply a positive boost, set the boost value higher than 1. To apply a negative boost, use values lower than 1. For example a value of 1.35 will positively boost a field by 135%. But using a value of 0.60 will apply a negative boost. Please note that it is not necessary to perform a full system index when boost values are changed for fields. For more information on how to enable or disable fields for Global Search or change the boost values, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Developer_Tools/Studio">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p><p>Global Search functions off of an index created from the data in your system. When creating and updating records, data is added and modified in the index accordingly. Occasionally the index can become corrupt or inefficient, which may require a system index to be performed. You can either perform a system index manually via Admin &gt; Search or schedule it by creating a scheduler for the full text search index system job in Admin &gt; Schedulers. For more information on how to run a system index on Full Text Search, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/System">System</a> documentation in the Administration guide.

The matching records will populate in the list view below the Search bar. Please note that the system retrieves all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. When looking up names, Sugar performs an OR search for each name entered. Records matching any of the names entered will appear in the list view. Sugar's list view search also supports wildcard characters (e.g. %) to search for records without including the entire word in the search query. For example, a search for "%univ" will pull up any records containing "univ", including "The University of Miami", "Miami University" or "Universidad de Miami". For more information on how to use wildcards in list view searches, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Search/#Wildcards_2">Wildcards</a> section of this documentation.</p><p>In addition, the search provides a Filter option which can be used in combination with the open Search box to narrow your search further using the available options on the list.

For example, if you select "My Accounts" in the Filter list and enter an account name, Sugar will only return account records with a matching name that are assigned to you. You can also create new filters if you wish to add more complex filters for your search criteria. For more information on creating new filters, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Search/#Creating_a_Filter">Creating a Filter</a> section of this documentation. When you run a search using a saved or created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away.</p><p>To see all records to which you have access, simply select the All "Module Name" (e.g. All Accounts) option in the filter.

The following wildcard characters can be used in the List View search box:</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Character</strong></td><td><strong>Wildcard Use</strong></td></tr><tr><td>%</td><td>Matches any number of characters, including zero</td></tr><tr><td>_</td><td>Matches only one character</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Please note that module search automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase for each text field. This allows the system to pull up all records that include the keyword entered in the search.</p><p>When performing a multiple-word search, Sugar will behave differently based on the module (e.g. Accounts, Contacts, etc.) in which you perform the search. For example, performing a search for "Max Hold" in the Accounts module will match an account named "Max Holding Company" but will not match "Maximum Holding Company" because the wildcard is appended to the end of the entire query (e.g. Max Hold%). However, if the same search is performed for "Max Hold" in the Contacts module, it will return search results matching a contact named "Max Holder" as well as "Maximillian Holder" because it appends a wildcard to the end of each word in the query (e.g. Max% Hold%). Please note that the latter behavior applies to any person-type module (e.g. Leads) to account for search results that may contain multiple words in the First Name and/or Last Name field (e.g. "Jean Paul" as a first name).</p><p>The following search examples illustrate List View search behavior:</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1"><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2"><strong>Search Criteria</strong></td><td colspan="2"><strong>Matching Search Results</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>First Name</strong></td><td><strong>Last Name</strong></td></tr><tr><td>rob</td><td><strong>Rob </strong><br /><strong>Rob</strong>erta<br />John</td><td>Smith<br />Collins<br /><strong>Rob</strong>erts</td></tr><tr><td>%bert</td><td><strong>Bert</strong><br />Ro<strong>bert</strong>a<br />John</td><td>Andernie<br />Collins<br />Ro<strong>bert</strong>s</td></tr><tr><td>r_b</td><td><strong>R</strong><span>o</span><strong>b</strong>erta <strong><br />R</strong><span>u</span><strong>b</strong>y<br />John</td><td>Collins<br />Lieu<br /><strong>R</strong><span>o</span><strong>b</strong>erts</td></tr><tr><td>%r_b</td><td><strong>R</strong><span>o</span><strong>b</strong><br />John<br />Mi<strong>r</strong><span>a</span><strong>b</strong>el</td><td>Smith<br /><strong>R</strong><span>o</span><strong>b</strong>erts<br />Glaston</td></tr><tr><td><span>__</span>it</td><td>Rob<br /><span>An</span><strong>it</strong>a</td><td><span>Sm</span><strong>it</strong>h<br />Nother</td></tr><tr><td>r_b% smit%</td><td><strong>Rob</strong>ert<br /><strong>Rob</strong></td><td><strong>Smit</strong>h<br /><strong>Smit</strong>e</td></tr><tr><td>rob smith</td><td><strong>Rob<br />Rob</strong>ert<br /><strong>Rob</strong> Roy</td><td><strong>Smith<br />Smith</strong><br /><strong>Smith</strong></td></tr><tr><td>smith</td><td>Rob <br /><strong>Smith</strong></td><td><strong>Smith<br /></strong>Johnson</td></tr><tr><td>jean</td><td><strong>Jean</strong>nine <br /><strong>Jean</strong> Paul</td><td>Pugh<br />Gaultier</td></tr><tr><td>paul</td><td>Sue<br /><strong>Paul</strong></td><td><strong>Paul</strong>son<br />Jones</td></tr><tr><td>jean paul</td><td><strong>Jean<br />Jean Paul</strong></td><td><strong>Paul</strong><br />Gaultier</td></tr></tbody></table><p>When performing a search, Sugar will try to match your search text to the beginning of a record's field. So, if an account name starts with an article like "A" or "The", this must be accounted for in the search by adding a wildcard (%) at the beginning of your text. For example, to properly pull up an account named "The ABC Company", you will have to enter "%abc" for Sugar to find a match in the system.</p><p>In addition, you can use the wildcard character when specifying the search criteria for custom filters with the "starts with" operator. Please note that the wildcard character will only work with the "starts with" operator. For example, if you wish to find all records containing the word "systems", then you can use the "starts with" operator and type "%systems" as the filter value. For more information on creating filters, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Search/#Creating_a_Filter">Creating a Filter</a> section of this documentation. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a6c2cf2c-d9f1-2d03-5c6d-5503043073a6.png" alt="Wildcard_Filter2" height="76" width="562" /></p><h3 id="e2ba1644-b986-eb10-8933-570e8a3ecc9b_AND_vs_OR">AND vs OR</h3><p>When searching in the List View search, Sugar uses the "and" operator. This means that if you are searching against multiple fields in your filter option, Sugar will place an "and" in between each search field returning only records matching all (as opposed to any) of your search criteria. For example, if you select "My Accounts" in the Filter options and enter an account name, Sugar will only return account records with a matching name that are assigned to you.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/541309a9-7b70-0a5d-2bbd-550304e808b5.png" alt="ListView_FilterOperator_And3" width="631" height="109" /></p><p>The only time Sugar will use the "or" operator is when using a multi-select option in the search criteria. For example, you can create a custom filter for the Accounts list view search and select "Type", "is any of", then add "Customer", "Partner", and "Analyst". If you perform a search based on this new filter, the system will return account records that match any one of the values specified in the filter. For more information on creating custom filters, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Search/#Creating_a_Filter">Creating a Filter</a> section of this documentation.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e90ba4b3-34e7-a008-8b90-55030454e91a.png" alt="CustomFilter_AndvsOR1" height="130" width="621" /></p><p>Please note that if any additional fields (e.g. industry, status, etc.) are added to the custom filter, the operators between the Type field and the other fields will be an "and" operator.</p><h3 id="e2ba1644-b986-eb10-8933-570e8a3ecc9b_Filter">Filter</h3><p>Module search provides a Filter option which allows users to narrow their search further using the available options on the list.</p><p>The following options are available to users when filtering their List View search:</p><ul><li><strong>Create</strong> : Create a new custom filter which you can use to filter your search</li><li><strong>All "Module Name"</strong> : Returns all records in the module to which you have access</li><li><strong>My "Module Name" </strong>: Returns only records assigned to you</li><li><strong>My Favorites</strong> : Returns only records you have marked as favorites</li><li><strong>Recently Created</strong> : Returns only records you created in the module within the last 7 days</li><li><strong>Recently Viewed </strong>: Returns only records you have viewed in the module within the last 7 days</li></ul><p>When you choose a filter and run a search, Sugar returns records with a matching name from within the filtered list view results.

This allows users to add custom, complex filter options when searching in the module's list view. You have the option to add multiple fields to your new filter and set select operators (e.g. is any of, is, starts with, etc.) along with their value(s). A filter's criteria need to be true for a record in order for it to appear in the list view search result. Additionally, filters with no specified values may be saved as a custom filter to act as a filter template when a user often searches using the same fields but with varying values. Please note that only fields you have view access for will appear in the Filter list when creating a search filter.</p><p>When you run a search using a created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away.</p><p>The following steps cover creating a filter for accounts with a type of "Customer", "Competitor", or "Partner", assigned to Sara Smith as an example:</p><ol><li>Click the Filter option on the Accounts search bar then select "Create". <ul><li><strong>Note</strong>: You can also click "Create" to the right of the Filter option.</li></ul><br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/c59e82b4-a81c-3b56-b821-550304564e3a.png" alt="ModuleSearch_Create" height="208" width="331" /></li><li>Select "Type" as the filter field and select the "is any of" operator then add "Customer", "Competitor", "Partner" as the search values.

When re-using the filter simply enter the appropriate filter value(s) and the list view will display the matching results. Once you are done with the filter, click "Reset" to the far right of the filter's name to clear the filter value(s). </p><p>The custom filter can always be edited as necessary by selecting the filter and updating the fields, conditions, values, etc. via the filter details panel.

For example, if you select "My Favorites" and enter in a record name to search, Sugar will only return records with a matching name that you have marked as favorites. When searching by a multiselect or dropdown field (e.g. "Assigned to"), however, Sugar will return records matching any of these selections. Once the search completes, the relevant results will populate in the list view below the search panel. To see all records to which you have access, simply click "Clear" and then "Search" to perform a blank search with no filters.

Users can pick which fields are displayed in the list view, the order they are displayed in, and which column the records are ordered by. <br />Use the following steps to personalize the list view for a module using the layout options from the advanced module search:</p><ol><li>Click on the Layout Options link to expand the available options below. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5c836e8d-4e62-9a91-60b9-55028d037f96.png" alt="Module_Search_Advanced_Layout_Options" width="612" height="199" /></li><li>Select any column name in the Display Columns panel and click the right aligned arrow to remove the column from the list view. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d2200249-c38a-7eec-085c-55028d7d4698.png" alt="Module_Search_Advanced_Layout_Options_Hide" width="329" height="149" /></li><li>Alternatively, select any column name in the Hide Columns panel and click the left aligned arrow to add a column to the list view. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/9877de41-d867-5899-8eba-55028d60c7f8.png" alt="Module_Search_Advanced_Layout_Options_Display" width="329" height="149" /></li><li>Select any column name in the Display Columns panel and click the up or down aligned arrow to move a column left or right respectively in the list view. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/1818b759-a53d-b12f-27ca-55028d1cfaae.png" alt="Module_Search_Advanced_Layout_Options_Move" width="329" height="149" /></li><li>In the Order By column dropdown, select a field to order your results by. Only columns in the Display panel will be available to order by and some columns (e.g. Email Address) are not available for sorting.</li><li>Select a direction you wish to order the fields by: Ascending : 1-10, A-Z; Descending : 10 -1, Z-A <p><strong>Note</strong>: Clicking on a column header in the list view will temporarily override the sort selected here. In order to order by the selection made here again, simply click the Search button.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/49730182-653b-8098-4807-55028da0e95b.png" alt="Module_Search_Advanced_Layout_Options_Order" width="378" height="114" /></p></li><li>Click Search to execute the search. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/7cae03e7-2f86-b049-a958-55028d740f98.png" alt="Module_Search_Advanced_Layout_Options_Search" width="450" height="45" /></li></ol><p>Not all columns in each module can be used in the layout options by default. If there is a column you desire to add to your list view or order by, please contact your Sugar administrator to enable the desired fields. For more information on how to add or remove fields as options in the layout options section, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Developer_Tools/Studio">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The layout options configured here supersede the default list view settings configured in Studio for the specified module. <br />Sugar remembers the last search run when you return to each module including whether or not the Layout Options panel was exposed. After changing your layout options, click "Layout Options" again to hide the expanded panel and click Search. Running a search locks in place whatever options you currently have on the search screen. Now the next time you run a search, the new options will be remembered and the Layout Options will be hidden. Click the Clear and the Search buttons to revert back to the default layout options.</p><h4 id="e2ba1644-b986-eb10-8933-570e8a3ecc9b_Saved_Search">Saved Search</h4><p>Sugar gives users the ability to save any layout option changes and search criteria for easy access to perform the same search at a later time. A common example of this would be a manager saving a search where only his or her employees are the Assigned Users on the record. This way, the manager can review all of their team's records at the click of a button. You can save an unlimited number of search results and the Saved Searches dropdown displays the last saved search at the top of the list. <br /><strong>Note</strong>: Saved searches are user specific and can not be seen or shared by other users.</p><p>Use the following steps to save a personalized search from the advanced module search:</p><ol><li>Enter in any number of search criteria you desire.</li><li>Enter in a name to designate the search into the "Save search as" textbox and click save. <p><strong>Note</strong>: Any layout option changes made will also be saved with the saved search.<img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/2fde4b39-0dc0-edd4-4981-55028da7db3e.png" alt="Module_Search_Advanced_Saved_Search" width="637" height="59" /></p></li><li>The search is saved and executed. You now have the ability to modify any search criteria or layout options. After any necessary modifications are made click the Update button next to "Modify current search". <p><strong>Note</strong>: The name of the search you will be updating shows below the Update button.<img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/cbeec27d-e194-c7c5-014e-55028d343e41.png" alt="Module_Search_Advanced_Saved_Search_Update" width="634" height="39" /></p></li><li>There is no way to modify the name of a saved search. Alternatively you can execute a saved search, enter a new name into the "Save search as" textbox and click save. This will create a new saved search with the same criteria as the original with the new name. You may then proceed to delete the old saved search.</li><li>To execute a previously saved search, simply select the desired search from the "Saved Searches" dropdown. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/973bee07-d75d-e79c-8e8c-55028dab8069.png" alt="Module_Search_Advanced_Saved_Search_Execute" width="494" height="95" /></li><li>This immediately executes the saved search.</li><li>If you wish to remove a saved search, simply click the Delete button after executing a previously saved search. <p><strong>Note</strong>: The name of the search you will be deleting shows below the Delete button.<img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/607a21a9-7647-a9fb-746d-55028d58dd18.png" alt="Module_Search_Advanced_Saved_Search_Delete" width="513" height="46" /></p></li></ol><h3 id="e2ba1644-b986-eb10-8933-570e8a3ecc9b_AND_vs_OR_2">AND vs OR</h3><p>When searching in the Basic or Advanced module search, Sugar uses the "and" operator, not "or". This means that if you are searching against multiple fields, Sugar will place an "and" in between each search field returning only records matching all of your search criteria. For example: A search performed for a record name "sugar" and the "My Items" check box will only return records where the record name contains "sugar" and the assigned to field is the user currently logged in.</p><p>The only time Sugar will use the "or" operator is when using the mutiselect options in the search criteria. For example : A search performed in the Accounts module for the industry field will allow you to select multiple options to search by. Performing a search on the industry field with Apparel, Banking, and Chemicals selected will return any records where industry is "Apparel" or "Banking" or "Chemicals".</p><p>If any other field is added into the search criteria the operators between the industry field and any other field will remain an "and" operator.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/50c50910-f058-7fb1-09a8-55028d4a28d8.png" alt="Module_Search_And_Operator" width="569" height="49" /></p><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/1d1fbb51-e20c-01e7-3cce-55028d9651cc.png" alt="Module_Search_And_Multiselect" width="655" height="254" /></p><h3 id="e2ba1644-b986-eb10-8933-570e8a3ecc9b_Wildcards_3">Wildcards</h3><p>Wildcards can be used to search for criteria without including the entire word in the search. Use a wildcard character in place of characters you do not require in your search. Use may use any number of wildcard characters in any combination you desire. Search operators can be combined for queries, but if quotation marks and wildcard characters are used together, the quotation marks will supersede the wildcard, resulting in a search for an exact match. The following wildcard characters can be used in the related module filters in Sugar:</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Character</strong></td><td><strong>Wildcard Use</strong></td></tr><tr><td>%</td><td>Use this wildcard to match any number of characters, including zero</td></tr><tr><td>_</td><td>Use this wildcard to match a single character</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Please note that a wildcard is implied at the end of all search queries. For example, searching for "Acme" will match account names like Acme Industries or Acme Funds. Insert a wildcard before your search query with a % sign (%Acme) to match account names that begin with or contain the query, such as "ABC Acme Industries". If performing a multiple word search, the wildcard is only appended to the last word and not all words.</p><p>The following are example searches using wildcards in related record search:</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Search Criteria</strong></td><td><strong>Matches</strong></td><td><strong>Does Not Match</strong></td></tr><tr><td>rob</td><td><strong>Rob</strong>, <strong>Rob</strong>ert, <strong>Rob</strong>in</td><td>Bob, Jacob</td></tr><tr><td>%bert</td><td>Al<strong>bert</strong>, <strong>Bert</strong>, Ro<strong>bert</strong></td><td>Bart</td></tr><tr><td>r_b</td><td><strong>Rob</strong>ert, <strong>Rub</strong>y</td><td>Bob, Raab</td></tr><tr><td>%s_i</td><td>Du<strong>sti</strong>n, Chri<strong>sti</strong>, <strong>Smi</strong>th</td><td>Sophie, Josephine</td></tr><tr><td>__it</td><td><strong>Nit</strong>a, <strong>Lit</strong>trell</td><td>Schmitt</td></tr><tr><td>r_b% smit%</td><td><strong>Rob</strong>ert <strong>Smit</strong>h, <strong>Rob</strong><strong>Smit</strong>e</td><td>Bob Smith, Robert Phillip</td></tr><tr><td>rob smit</td><td><strong>Rob Smit</strong>h, <strong>Rob Smit</strong>e</td><td>John Smith</td></tr></tbody></table><p>When performing a search, Sugar will try to match your search text to the beginning of a record's field. Therefore, if an account name starts with an article like "A" or "The", this must be accounted for in the search by adding a wildcard (%) at the beginning of your text. For example, to properly return an account named "The ABC Company", you should enter "%abc" for Sugar to find a match in the system.</p><h3 id="e2ba1644-b986-eb10-8933-570e8a3ecc9b_Search_Memory">Search Memory</h3><p>Sugar by default automatically saves your most recent search criteria when leaving the module then repopulates the search fields the next time you return. For example: Perform a search in the Accounts module for "sugar". Navigate away from the Accounts module and then return back to the Accounts module. The search for "sugar" will automatically be shown and the relevant results will be shown below in the list view.</p><p><strong>Note</strong> : This can be an unintended result if a user is unaware of this functionality. For example: A search may have an assigned user selected that is not currently visible in the scrolling selection box. When running a new search, best practice is to click the Clear button before entering your search criteria.</p><p>Module search memory can be set to one of the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Remember last search</strong> : This is the default behavior in Sugar</li><li><strong>Populate only</strong> : This will populate the search criteria, but will not execute the search. <br /><strong>Note</strong> : This is recommended for systems experiencing performance issues.</li><li><strong>Do not remember last search</strong> : Search will be cleared and executed every time the search is loaded</li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: These options are global settings and will affect all users. Please be sure to inform users of any behavior change before making modifications.</p><h3 id="e2ba1644-b986-eb10-8933-570e8a3ecc9b_Admin_Configuration_2">Admin Configuration</h3><p>A Sugar administrator has many options for configuring module search.

You can convert leads via the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Leads/#Steps_to_Convert_a_Lead">Leads record view</a> as well as the Leads subpanel in a related module record (e.g. Accounts). To initiate the conversion process from the Leads subpanel, simply select "Convert" from the Actions menu on the far right of the lead record's row in the subpanel. When the lead is converted, a new contact record is created in Sugar with a relationship to the original lead record. The Convert Lead page also gives you the option to create an account and opportunity record.</p><p>Administrators have the ability to configure the Convert Lead layout via Admin &gt; Studio to mark modules as required for conversion, add additional modules (e.g. Notes, Tasks, etc.) to the convert layout, remove modules, etc. For more information on configuring the convert layout, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Developer_Tools/Studio">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration Guide.</p><h3 id="e2bcaadd-478f-3f06-2cbb-570e8a12bfd2_Lead_Conversion_Options">Lead Conversion Options</h3><p>The lead's activities can be moved to the contact record created during conversion or left attached only to the lead depending on the lead conversion option selected by your administrator via Admin &gt; System Settings.

Users can manage these newsletter subscriptions from the Leads record view using the Manage Subscriptions option in the Actions menu. Please note that you can only manage subscriptions for newsletter-type campaigns. A newsletter campaign you have created will have one or more default-type target lists. Leads are added to these target lists in order to receive your newsletter.

When a mass marketing campaign is sent to a lead (or manually marked as sent in the case of non-email campaigns), the related campaign activity information will appear within the Campaign Log subpanel on the contact's record view. This information mirrors the "View Status" page available from within each individual campaign and shows activities such as when a campaign was sent, when the recipient viewed the campaign message, when the recipient clicked a tracked link within the campaign, etc. Since this subpanel contains historical campaign interactions for the lead, it cannot be used to associate a lead with a campaign or otherwise manage a campaign or target list.

When an opportunity is imported into Sugar, at least one revenue line item must also be imported and related to the opportunity in order to populate the amounts (e.g. best, likely, etc.) and Expected Close Date field on the opportunity record. When you are importing opportunity and revenue line items, please be sure to import your opportunities first, followed by your revenue line items.

Administrators must first add desired currencies and exchange rates to Sugar via Admin &gt; Currencies. They also have the ability to set the instance's default currency via Admin &gt; Locale. This is typically the currency of the country where the majority of business is conducted. For more information, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/System">System</a> documentation in the Administration Guide.</p><p>Users can specify their own preferred currency in their user profiles. If they choose to also enable the Show Preferred Currency option in their profiles, currency fields throughout Sugar will display in their chosen currency. For more information, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Getting_Started">Getting Started</a> documentation. Finally, each revenue line item record has a Currency field where you will specify the currency being used for this particular business transaction.</p><h3 id="e2c08292-4909-ce5d-4edf-570e8a2f4bc5_Filtering_on_Currency_Fields">Filtering on Currency Fields</h3><p>Currency fields are filtered according to the record's set currency rather than being standardized to the user's preferred or system default currency. In the list view, filtering revenue line items by a currency field allows you to specify the filter's currency. Only records matching both the chosen currency and amount range will be returned. For example, if you filter based on a Likely value that equals 500 in US Dollars, then the search result will return all line items with a Likely value of $500 but will exclude values of &euro;500 or other currency values which are equivalent to $500. When filtering in reports, you will only specify the amount range, and any record matching that amount, regardless of the record's currency, will be returned. For example, if one revenue line item's Likely value is $500 in US Dollars and another's is &euro;500 in Euros, filtering for a Likely value of exactly 500 will return both records in the report.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b8bd7b26-c106-ecff-323f-564f800665cc.png" alt="RLI ListView Filtering on Currency" width="651" height="268" /></p><h3 id="e2c08292-4909-ce5d-4edf-570e8a2f4bc5_Updating_Currency_Rates">Updating Currency Rates</h3><p>When saving a revenue line item in a currency that differs from the system-defined default currency, Sugar will store the conversion rate for that currency at the record level. This conversion rate is used to calculate the converted amounts when the field is set to use the system default currency (as opposed to the user's preferred currency which is explained below). To keep amounts historically accurate, the conversion rate will only update on a revenue line item provided the sales stage is not set to "Closed Won" or "Closed Lost". If the line item is in any other sales stage, the conversion rate will update under the following scenarios:</p><ul><li>The revenue line item undergoes a save event (e.g. mass update, manual save, etc.) and the record's currency has a different conversion rate defined in Admin &gt; Currencies than is currently saved in the opportunity.</li><li>An administrator updates the currency exchange rate under Admin &gt; Currencies. This will trigger a scheduled job which updates all revenue line items saved with that currency to the new rate.</li></ul><p>When the viewing user's profile has the Show Preferred Currency option selected, the converted amounts display in the user's preferred currency. In this case, the conversion rate used to calculate the converted amounts is drawn directly from the conversion rate at the system level rather than any conversion rate stored on the record. This means that the value will always use the current conversion rate regardless of the line item's sales stage. For this reason, the converted amount fields should not be considered historically accurate for closed revenue line items when it is using the user's preferred currency. For information about setting a user's Preferred Currency and Show Preferred Currency options, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Getting_Started">Getting Started</a> documentation.</p><h2 id="e2c08292-4909-ce5d-4edf-570e8a2f4bc5_Emails_and_Revenue_Line_Items">Emails and Revenue Line Items</h2><p>Revenue line items may be related to emails by being selected in the email's Related To field.

Once the operation completes, you will be navigated to the new opportunity's record view. The opportunity will be pre-populated with the original quote's values in the Name, Account Name, Expected Close Date, Best, Likely, and Worst fields. The opportunity's type will default to "New Business" , the status to "In Progress", and the lead source to "Self Generated". Each quoted line item within the quote will become a revenue line item within the new opportunity. By default, the sales stage is set to "Proposal/Price Quote", the probability to "65%", and the type to "New Business". Because the probability defaults to 65%, the revenue line item will, by default, have a Forecast field value of "Exclude" meaning it will not be included in forecasts. You can edit the revenue line items and the opportunity record to modify any of these values as needed. The original quote will be related to the new opportunity and can be found in the Quotes subpanel on the opportunity's record view. For more information on creating an opportunity from a quote, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Quotes">Creating Opportunities from Quotes</a> section of the Quotes documentation.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/319109da-b1ee-5246-49ab-5654fc1e2a92.png" alt="Quote to Opp" width="302" height="244" /></p></div></div><div><p><small><b>Last Modified:</b> 10/11/2016 06:30pm</small></p></div><h1 id="id-e2c224e6-2314-4f90-48ff-570e8a5ec7f6">Opportunities</h1><div><h2 id="e2c224e6-2314-4f90-48ff-570e8a5ec7f6_Overview">Overview</h2><div><p>Sugar's Opportunities module allows you to track individual sales and their line items from start to finish. Each opportunity record serves as a header for a group of revenue line items as well as relating to other important records such as quotes, contacts, etc. Each revenue line item is the prospective sale of a particular product and includes relevant sale data. Each revenue line item will typically progress through several Sales Stages until it is marked either "Closed Won" or "Closed Lost". The Opportunity record reflects the amount and expected close date of its revenue line items. Opportunities and revenue line items can be leveraged even further by using Sugar's Forecasting module to understand and predict sales trends as well as focus work to achieve sales quotas. For more information on the Forecasts module, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Forecasts">Forecasts</a> documentation.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: If your instance is configured to use opportunities alone without revenue line items, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Pro/Application_Guide/Opportunities">Opportunities</a> documentation in the Professional Edition Application Guide. For more information about changing your opportunities model via Admin &gt; Opportunities, please see the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Opportunities">Opportunities Configuration</a> documentation in the Administration Guide.</p><p>You can view opportunity information in opportunity-based dashlets such as "My Closed Opportunities".

The opportunity's type will default to "New Business", the status to "In Progress", and the lead source to "Self Generated". Each quoted line item within the quote will become a revenue line item within the new opportunity. By default, the sales stage is set to "Proposal/Price Quote", the probability to "65%", and the type to "New Business". Because the probability defaults to 65%, the revenue line item will, by default, have a Forecast field value of "Exclude" meaning it will not be included in forecasts.

The Contacts subpanel allows users to select a role (e.g. Primary Decision Maker, Business Evaluator, etc.) for each related contact to help you classify how each individual will ultimately factor into the buying decision. To select a role, simply choose "Edit" from the Actions menu on the far right of the record's row in the subpanel. The record's row will open up within the subpanel allowing you to edit the individual fields.

Administrators must first add desired currencies and exchange rates to Sugar via Admin &gt; Currencies. They also have the ability to set the instance's default currency via Admin &gt; Locale. This is typically the currency of the country where the majority of business is conducted. For more information, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/System">System</a> documentation in the Administration Guide.</p><p>Users can specify their own preferred currency in their user profiles. If they choose to also enable the Show Preferred Currency option in their profiles, currency fields throughout Sugar will display in their chosen currency. For more information, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Getting_Started">Getting Started</a> documentation. Finally, each opportunity record has a Currency field where you will specify the currency being used for this particular business transaction.</p><h3 id="e2c224e6-2314-4f90-48ff-570e8a5ec7f6_Filtering_on_Currency_Fields">Filtering on Currency Fields</h3><p>Currency fields are filtered according to the record's set currency rather than being standardized to the user's preferred or system default currency. In the list view, filtering opportunities by a currency field allows you to specify the filter's currency. Only records matching both the chosen currency and amount range will be returned. For example, if you filter based on a Likely value that equals 500 in US Dollars, then the search result will return all opportunities with a Likely value of $500 but will exclude values of &euro;500 or other currency values which are equivalent to $500. When filtering in reports, you will only specify the amount range, and any record matching that amount, regardless of the record's currency, will be returned. For example, if one opportunity's Likely value is $500 in US Dollars and another's is &euro;500 in Euros, filtering for a Likely value of exactly 500 will return both records in the report.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e610433f-d3e9-41e3-3e02-5654c39e352e.png" alt="Opps Currencies Filter" width="615" height="266" /></p><h3 id="e2c224e6-2314-4f90-48ff-570e8a5ec7f6_Updating_Currency_Rates">Updating Currency Rates</h3><p>When saving an opportunity in a currency that differs from the system-defined default currency, Sugar will store the conversion rate for that currency at the record level. This conversion rate is used to calculate the converted Likely, Best, and Worst amounts when the field is set to use the system default currency (as opposed to the user's preferred currency which is explained below). To keep amounts historically accurate, the conversion rate will only update on an opportunity provided the sales stage is not set to "Closed Won" or "Closed Lost". If the opportunity is in any other sales stage, the conversion rate will update under the following scenarios:</p><ul><li>The opportunity undergoes a save event (e.g. mass update, manual save, etc.) and the record's currency has a different conversion rate defined in Admin &gt; Currencies than is currently saved in the opportunity.</li><li>An administrator updates the currency exchange rate under Admin &gt; Currencies. This will trigger a scheduled job which updates all opportunities saved with that currency to the new rate.</li></ul><p>When the viewing user's profile has the Show Preferred Currency option selected, the converted Likely, Best, and Worst amounts display in the user's preferred currency. In this case, the conversion rate used to calculate the converted amounts is drawn directly from the conversion rate at the system level rather than any conversion rate stored on the record. This means that the value will always use the current conversion rate regardless of the opportunity's sales stage. For this reason, the converted amount fields should not be considered historically accurate for closed opportunities when it is using the user's preferred currency.

Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Quotes list view below. Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Please note that Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %services). This will pull up any record that has the word "services" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p><p>For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Search">Search</a> documentation.</p><h3 id="e2c6599b-2400-575b-fdcc-570e8aff2e46_Basic_Search">Basic Search</h3><p>Basic search offers a few, commonly used fields for a simplified search experience.

This conversion rate is used to calculate the Converted Amount when the field is set to use the system default currency (as opposed to the user's preferred currency which is explained below). To keep amounts historically accurate, the conversion rate will only update on a quote provided the quote stage is not set to "Closed Accepted", "Closed Lost", or "Closed Dead". If the quote is in any other stage, the conversion rate will update under the following scenarios:</p><ul><li>The quote undergoes a save event (e.g. mass update, manual save, etc.) and the record's currency has a different conversion rate defined in Admin &gt; Currencies than is currently saved in the quote.</li><li>An administrator updates the currency exchange rate under Admin &gt; Currencies. This will trigger a scheduled job which updates all quotes saved with that currency to the new rate.</li></ul><p>When the viewing user's profile has the Show Preferred Currency option selected, the Converted Amount field displays the Transactional Amount in the user's preferred currency. In this case, the conversion rate used to calculate the Converted Amount's value is drawn directly from the conversion rate at the system level rather than any conversion rate stored on the record. This means that the value will always use the current conversion rate regardless of the opportunity's sales stage. For this reason, the Converted Amount field should not be considered historically accurate for closed quotes when it is using the user's preferred currency. For information about setting a user's Preferred Currency and Show Preferred Currency options, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Getting_Started">Getting Started</a> documentation.</p><p>For more information about currency exchange rates, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/System">System</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p></div></div><div><p><small><b>Last Modified:</b> 09/22/2016 05:45pm</small></p></div><h1 id="id-e2c88496-f7e5-bf39-1702-570e8a771ad3">Quoted Line Items</h1><div><h2 id="e2c88496-f7e5-bf39-1702-570e8a771ad3_Overview">Overview</h2><div><p>Sugar's Quoted Line Items module consists of the individual line items which make up your organization's sales quotes. These line items are all of the products that have already been sold or are in the process of being sold to clients along with a quantity, price, and potential discounts. Since a quote is made up of one or more quoted line items, you will often create quoted line items while creating the quote itself. You can view the quoted line item's details in record view by clicking the line item in a quote or by navigating to it directly via the Quoted Line Items module if your administrator has enabled the module to appear in Sugar's navigation bar. For more information about how quotes and quoted line items interact, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Quoted_Line_Items/#Quotes_and_Quoted_Line_Items">Quotes and Quoted Line Items</a> section of this page. </p><p>Each quoted line item will include a product that is being sold. The product can be selected from the product catalog or can be typed in manually.

Administrators must first add desired currencies and exchange rates to Sugar via Admin &gt; Currencies. They also have the ability to set the instance's default currency via Admin &gt; Locale. This is typically the currency of the country where the majority of business is conducted. For more information, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/System">System</a> documentation in the Administration Guide.</p><p>Users can specify their own preferred currency in their user profiles. If they choose to also enable the Show Preferred Currency option in their profiles, currency fields throughout Sugar will display in their chosen currency. For more information, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Getting_Started">Getting Started</a> documentation. Finally, each quoted line item record has a Currency field where you will specify the currency being used for this particular business transaction.</p><h3 id="e2c88496-f7e5-bf39-1702-570e8a771ad3_Filtering_on_Currency_Fields">Filtering on Currency Fields</h3><p>When you are filtering quoted line items in the list view, currency fields (e.g. Cost) will be filtered according to each record's selected currency. So for example, if you filter based on a Likely value that equals 500 in US Dollars, then the search result will return all quoted line item records with a Likely value of $500. When filtering in reports, the quoted line items' values will not be standardized to the user's preferred or system default currency. For example, if one quoted line item's cost is $50 in US Dollars and another's is &euro;50 in Euros, filtering for a cost of exactly 50 will return both records in the report result.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/ad268186-c0ea-bee1-ecef-564fa1840fb2.png" alt="QLI Filtering by Cost Field" width="636" height="246" /></p><h3 id="e2c88496-f7e5-bf39-1702-570e8a771ad3_Updating_Currency_Rates">Updating Currency Rates</h3><p>When saving a quoted line item in a currency that differs from the system-defined default currency, Sugar will store the conversion rate for that currency at the record level. This conversion rate is used to calculate the converted amounts when they are set to use the system default currency (as opposed to the user's preferred currency which is explained below). To keep amounts historically accurate, the conversion rate will only update on a quoted line item provided the status is not set to "Shipped". If the line item is in any other sales stage, the conversion rate will update under the following scenarios:</p><ul><li>The quoted line item undergoes a save event (e.g. mass update, manual save, etc.) and the record's currency has a different conversion rate defined in Admin &gt; Currencies than is currently saved in the line item.</li><li>An administrator updates the currency exchange rate under Admin &gt; Currencies. This will trigger a scheduled job which updates all quoted line items saved with that currency to the new rate.</li></ul><p>When the viewing user's profile has the Show Preferred Currency option selected, the converted amount fields display in the user's preferred currency. In this case, the conversion rate is drawn directly from the conversion rate at the system level rather than any conversion rate stored on the record. This means that the value will always use the current conversion rate regardless of the quoted line item's status. For this reason, the Price and List fields should not be considered historically accurate for closed business when it is using the user's preferred currency. For information about setting a user's Preferred Currency and Show Preferred Currency options, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Getting_Started">Getting Started</a> documentation.</p></div></div></div><div><p><small><b>Last Modified:</b> 04/13/2016 02:07pm</small></p></div><h1 id="id-e2caacce-0df2-6c3d-3e7c-570e8a8d317c">Contracts</h1><div><p></p><h2 id="e2caacce-0df2-6c3d-3e7c-570e8a8d317c_Overview">Overview</h2><p>Sugar's Contracts module consists of individual business arrangements your organization has with vendors, customers, or association.

Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Contracts list view below. Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Please note that Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %services). This will pull up any record that has the word "services" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p><p>For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Search">Search</a> documentation.</p><h3 id="e2caacce-0df2-6c3d-3e7c-570e8a8d317c_Basic_Search">Basic Search</h3><p>Basic search offers a few, commonly used fields for a simplified search experience.

For example, if you select "My Items" and enter a contract name, Sugar will only return contract records with a matching name that are assigned to you. Once the search is complete, the relevant results will populate in the list view below the search panel. To see all contract records to which you have access, simply click "Clear" and then "Search" to perform a blank search with no filters.

For more information on how to mark records as favorites, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Contracts/#Favoriting_Contracts">Favoriting Contracts</a> section of this documentation. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/80563e44-5f04-e5e3-9446-550309c39d31.png" alt="Detail_View_Favorite_Designation" width="276" height="152" /></p><h3 id="e2caacce-0df2-6c3d-3e7c-570e8a8d317c_Next_or_Previous_Record">Next or Previous Record</h3><p>On the upper right of the Contracts detail view, there are two buttons that allow you to page through each contract in the Contracts list view's current search results. Clicking the Previous button displays the previous contract of the current search results while clicking the Next button displays the next contract of the current search results. The text in between shows which contract result you are currently viewing within the total number of current results. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/c5b8009b-1c78-1724-ee4d-550301598bbc.png" alt="Detail_View_Pagination" width="483" height="107" /></p><h3 id="e2caacce-0df2-6c3d-3e7c-570e8a8d317c_Related_Record_Subpanels">Related Record Subpanels</h3><p>The most common type of subpanels displayed on a contract's detail view contain the contract's related records belonging to various modules. The relationship type determines whether a related record will be displayed in the field listing or in a subpanel. For example, a contract may be related to only one account but related to multiple contacts. This means that the related account will be displayed amongst the contract's fields while contacts will be displayed in a subpanel beneath the fields. <br />Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to change the fields (e.g. Name, Assigned User, etc.) and labels of each subpanel by configuring the layout via Admin &gt; Studio to provide visibility to the most important fields. For more information on modifying subpanels, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Developer_Tools/Studio">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide. <br />Related record subpanels allow the following operations to be performed. Please note that administrators in Sugar can change the subpanel's Action menu to be displayed as separate buttons instead of a dropdown via Admin &gt; System Settings. For more information, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/System">System</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p><ul><li>To view the details of a related record, click the record's name in the subpanel to open it in detail view.</li><li>To relate an existing record to the contract, choose "Select" from the subpanel's Action menu, then locate and select the desired record.</li><li>To relate a new record to the contract, choose "Create" from the subpanel's Action menu, then complete the Quick Create form and click "Save".</li><li>To edit a related record, choose "Edit" on the far right of the record's row.</li><li>To delete the contract's relationship to a record, choose "Unlink" from the dropdown on the far right of the record's row. This removes the relationship, but does not delete the record itself.</li><li>To collapse or expand the subpanel, click the double arrow to the left of the subpanel's name.</li><li>To move the subpanel to a new location on the detail view, drag and drop the subpanel's header.</li></ul><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/7ba70524-fc36-499c-e440-550309888273.png" alt="Detail_View_Related_Records" width="670" height="128" /><br />Please note that administrators can prevent users from moving subpanels to different locations in the detail view. For more information on preventing rearranging of subpanels, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/System">System</a> documentation in the Administration guide.

Template documents give users the ability to perform additional actions on the document through the contracts module. This feature is best used for a standard contract or agreement document that the organization will have to sign. Once the contract is signed by the organization, users can click "Sign" on the related document record. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8f450ad1-8db2-8150-ddaa-550309d6f641.png" alt="Detail_View_Documents_Sign" width="427" height="65" /></p><p>This prompts the user to create a new document record for the signed contract, which will be related to the template document as well as the contract record. You will now see both documents, the original contract template and the signed contract, in the documents subpanel of the contract record. <br /><br />Once a document related to a contract gets revised you have the option of pulling the latest revision to be linked to the contract. Otherwise the version of the document that existed when linked to the contract will remain linked. Click "Get Latest" to link the most recent version of the document to the contract. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/23a51e00-a336-eb73-2ad8-5503091d92fc.png" alt="Detail_View_Documents_Get_Latest" width="424" height="101" /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e46611f1-2117-0d07-a747-5503091dee06.png" alt="Detail_View_Documents" width="670" height="87" /></p><h2 id="e2caacce-0df2-6c3d-3e7c-570e8a8d317c_Editing_Contracts">Editing Contracts</h2><p>Contracts may be edited at any time to update or add information to the record. You can make changes to existing contract records via the Contracts edit view and quick create forms.

Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Documents list view below. Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Please note that Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %agreement). This will pull up any record that has the word "agreement" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends. <br />For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Search">Search</a> documentation.</p><h3 id="e2ccd0f2-8409-d358-94a5-570e8a3917ab_Basic_Search">Basic Search</h3><p>Basic search offers a few, commonly used fields for a simplified search experience.

The relationship type determines whether a related record will be displayed in the field listing or in a subpanel. For example, a document may be related to only one other document but related to multiple accounts. This means that the related document will be displayed amongst the document's fields while accounts will be displayed in a subpanel beneath the fields.</p><p>Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to change the fields (e.g. Name, Assigned User, etc.) and labels of each subpanel by configuring the layout via Admin &gt; Studio to provide visibility to the most important fields.

The record view opens in edit mode when creating the call directly from the Calls menu, Quick Create menu, and Calendar module and includes all of the relevant fields for your organization. When using quick create to make a call while viewing an existing record of another module, Sugar automatically creates a relationship between both records. For example, if you are viewing a contact record (e.g. John Smith) and create a new call via its record view, the Related To field in the call record will automatically populate with "John Smith", thus creating the relationship and adding him as an invitee. The record view layout can be configured by administrators via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on configuring layouts, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Developer_Tools/Studio">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p><h3 id="e2ceca17-1db3-81b6-33c6-570e8a63520a_Creating_Via_Calendar_Grid">Creating Via Calendar Grid</h3><p>The calendar allows you to create meetings and calls easily by clicking on the cell corresponding to the specific date and time you wish to schedule the activity.

You can schedule upcoming calls that remind you when the scheduled time approaches or log calls you have already held in order to keep a record of the discussion. Call records can have multiple attendees, both inside and outside Sugar, and include the ability to send invitations as well as reminder emails. When a phone call is repeated on a regular schedule, you can configure the call record to recur. Sugar's Calendar module will display your call records and allows you to create calls directly from your calendar. Calls can also be viewed and created via the Planned Activities dashlet on related module records (e.g. contacts). For example, a contact record's Planned Activities dashlet will display Sugar call records that are related to the contact. Creating a call from the dashlet automatically creates a relationship between both records. This documentation will cover information and actions specific to the Calls module. For instructions concerning views and actions which are common across most Sugar modules, such as creating, editing, and deleting calls, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Calls/#Working_With_Calls">Working With Calls</a> section of this page. </p><p>Please note that you will only be able to see call records as allowed by your team membership, user access type, and assigned roles.

You can schedule upcoming meetings that remind you when teh scheduled time approaches or log meetings you have already held in order to keep a record of the discussion. Meeting records can have multiple attendees, both inside and outside Sugar, and include the ability to send invitations as well as reminder emails. When a meeting is repeated on a regular schedule, you can configure the call record to recur. Sugar's Calendar module will display your meeting records and allows you to create meetings directly from your calendar. Meetings can also be viewed and created via the Planned Activities dashlet on related module records (e.g. contacts). For example, a contact record's Planned Activities dashlet will display Sugar meeting records that are related to the contact. Creating a meeting from the dashlet automatically creates a relationship between both records. This documentation will cover information and actions specific to the Meetings module. For instructions concerning views and actions which are common across most Sugar modules, such as creating, editing, and deleting calls, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Meetings/#Working_With_Meetings">Working With Meetings</a> section of this page. </p><p>Please note that you will only be able to see meeting records as allowed by your team membership, user access type, and assigned roles.

Each Sugar instance has its own unique Sugar Email Archiving mailbox. To import emails, a user sends or forwards emails to the unique Sugar Email Archiving email address using the To, Cc, or Bcc fields. The Sugar Email Archiving service will import the email into the Sugar instance. The service imports the email, along with any attachments, images, and calendar events, then creates records within the application that are associated with existing records by matching email addresses in the To and Cc fields. In addition, the Sugar Email Archiving service will also scan the body of the email to archive the email to records with a matching email address. Please note that in order for the email address to be recognized properly for email archiving, it must be displayed as "To: (End Client Name (optional)) " (e.g. To: John Smith john@example.com&gt;) in the body of the email. The archived email will appear in the History dashlet for any matching records in Sugar. The imported emails will also be related to a specified case number by including the case macro and the case number (i.e. [CASE:{number}]) in the subject of the email.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Email Archiving cannot read email addresses from the Bcc field the same as when you receive an email.<br />Emails can be sent to the Sugar Email Archiving address and viewed in the History dashlets in Record View pages for the following modules:</p><ul><li>Accounts</li><li>Contacts</li><li>Leads</li><li>Opportunities</li><li>Cases</li></ul><p>Emails with .ics meeting attachments sent to SNIP are parsed by Sugar. The Meeting record is created and for every email that is invited to the meeting, if User, Contact or Lead record exists matching this email, this record is added to the list of invitees for the meeting. </p><p>Email Archiving can be configured via Admin &gt; Email Archiving. For more information on how to setup and configure Email Archiving, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Email">Email</a> documentation in the administration guide.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: If the email client is configured to use non-English From, To, and Cc fields, forwarding emails inline to Email Archiving may not work. Send the email to Email Archiving directly using the Cc and Bcc fields or forward the email as an attachment.

The results of each campaign are recorded to measure its impact. Targets are not related directly to campaigns. Rather, each campaign is related to several target list records, and each target list is related to targets and other recipients. To send a campaign email to a target, the target should belong to a default-type target list associated to the campaign. To prevent a target from receiving emails from a campaign, the target should belong to the campaign's suppression list-type target list. Once a campaign is sent, the results specific to a particular target will appear in the Campaign Log Subpanel on the target's record view as described in the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Targets/#Campaign_Log_Subpanel">Campaign Log Subpanel</a> section of this page.</p><p>Targets can be added to target lists via the target list record itself, from the Targets list view using the Add To Target List option, or from the Targets record view using the Manage Subscriptions option.

Before sending out an email-based campaign, an administrator must make sure the following items are set up properly:</p><ul><li><strong>Outbound Emails</strong> : Configure Sugar to send outbound emails via Admin &gt; Email Settings. For more information on configuring outbound email, please refer to <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Campaigns/#Set_Up_Email">Set Up Email</a> below or to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Email">Email</a> documentation in the Administration Guide.</li><li><strong>Campaign Batch Size</strong> : Specify the number of emails sent per batch via Admin &gt; Campaign Email Settings. Due to some email providers throttling the number of emails allowed to be sent at one time, we recommend setting this to 200 and adjusting as necessary. For more information on configuring the campaign batch size, please refer to <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Campaigns/#Set_Up_Email">Set Up Email</a> below or to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Email">Email</a> documentation in the Administration Guide.</li><li><strong>Bounce Handling Account</strong> : Create the bounce-handling inbox for bounced campaign emails via Admin &gt; Inbound Email. For more information on configuring the bounce handling account, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Email">Email</a> documentation in the Administration Guide.</li><li><strong>Campaigns Scheduler</strong> : Configure the scheduler job that automatically sends campaign emails via Admin &gt; Schedulers &gt; Run Nightly Mass Email Campaigns Scheduler. The frequency of this scheduler should be determined in conjunction with the campaign batch size to ensure you do not exceed sending limitations imposed by your email provider. For more information on configuring schedulers, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/System/Schedulers">Schedulers</a> documentation in the Administration Guide.</li><li><strong>Bounced Emails Scheduler</strong> : Configure the scheduler job to process the bounced campaign emails via Admin &gt; Schedulers &gt; Run Nightly Process Bounced Campaign Emails Scheduler. For more information on configuring schedulers, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/System/Schedulers">Schedulers</a> documentation in the Administration Guide. <br /><strong>Note</strong>: The Run Nightly Mass Email Campaigns and Run Nightly Processed Bounced Campaign Emails schedulers are configured by default to run every night on the hour from 2:00 AM to 6:00 AM for the time zone of the admin user (User Id = 1). For quicker processing of campaign information we recommend changing both schedulers to run every 10 minutes throughout the day. Please note that if your email provider throttles the number of emails allowed to be sent in a given time period, you may need to reduce the frequency of sending.</li></ul><h3 id="e2e0d510-23d5-c3f8-3979-570e8a2b51e4_Set_Up_Email">Set Up Email</h3><p>In addition to navigating directly to the email settings on the Administration page, you can also configure Sugar's email settings for campaigns via the Set Up Email option in the Campaigns module tab.

The main types and their differences are as follows:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Newsletter</strong> : A series of mass emails sent to a consistent or growing target list periodically or on a regular basis. Each newsletter is intended to be managed on a subscription basis and is normally targeted towards individuals with whom you have an existing relationship. The Frequency field is only available for campaigns with the type set to "Newsletter". Recipients opting out of newsletter-type campaigns are added to that campaign's unsubscription list but will still be able to receive other campaigns' emails.</p></li><li><p><strong>Email Campaign</strong> : A one-time or series of mass emails sent to a target list. Email campaigns are typically targeted towards a wide audience with the intention of lead generation. Recipients opting out of email-type campaigns have their email address marked as "opt-out" and are prevented from receiving any future campaign emails.</p></li><li><p><strong>Non-email based Campaign</strong> : A non-email mass marketing effort delivered via mail, web, radio, television, print, or telesales. These campaigns are not executed through Sugar, but you can create a campaign record and manually update send dates and results for record keeping and to assess return on investment.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: Non-email based campaigns will not display Tracker URLs and Email Marketing subpanels in the detail view.</p><h2 id="e2e0d510-23d5-c3f8-3979-570e8a2b51e4_Creating_Campaigns">Creating Campaigns</h2><p>There are two primary methods for creating a campaign in Sugar: the Create Campaign (Classic) option and the Create Campaign (Wizard) option. When using the classic option, you will create the campaign record then add the target list and create tracker URLs as well as an email marketing record via the related subpanels below the campaign's detail. The classic option is recommended for simplicity and empowering users to make modifications to the campaign later. The campaign wizard option will walk you through getting the campaign created step-by-step. Each step of the campaign set-up process will guide users on the items (Tracker URLs, Target List, Marketing, etc.) that need to be completed.</p><h3 id="e2e0d510-23d5-c3f8-3979-570e8a2b51e4_Creating_Via_Classic_Option">Creating Via Classic Option</h3><p>Creating a campaign using the classic method opens the Campaigns edit view where you may enter the basic campaign information. Use the following steps to create a campaign via the classic option:</p><ol><li><p>Click the Actions menu in the Campaigns module tab and select "Create Campaign (Classic)". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8153b8fb-0917-a007-0583-550307682257.png" alt="Campaigns_ActionsMenu_CreateCampaignClassic" width="350" height="147" /></p></li><li><p>Enter appropriate values for the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Campaigns/#Campaign_Fields">fields</a> in the edit view layout which will help identify the campaign.

The Copy option is useful if the campaign you are creating has similar information to an existing campaign. When duplicating a campaign, the campaign data, and the related target lists will copy over, but the original campaign's tracker URLs and Email Marketing records will not be related to the new campaign. <br />Use the following steps to create a campaign by duplicating an existing campaign record:</p><ol><li>Navigate to a campaign record's detail view.</li><li>Click the Actions menu and select "Copy".<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/bdd8177e-475a-0343-ea44-5503071345ff.png" alt="Campaigns_DetailView_ActionsMenu_Copy" width="310" height="151" /></li><li>The displayed edit view is pre-populated with the original campaign's values. Update the necessary fields, then click "Save".<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/be9d0746-a082-4b1a-092e-5503079525b7.png" alt="Campaigns_CreatingViaDuplication_Save" width="330" height="169" /></li></ol><p>Once the campaign record has been created, scroll to the related subpanels below the campaign's detail to add the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Campaigns/#Creating_Target_Lists">target list</a> and create the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Campaigns/#Creating_Tracker_URLs">tracker URLs</a> as well as an <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Campaigns/#Creating_Email_Marketing_Records">email marketing</a> record.</p><h3 id="e2e0d510-23d5-c3f8-3979-570e8a2b51e4_Creating_Target_Lists">Creating Target Lists</h3><p>A target list consists of a collection of individuals or organizations you want to include or exclude in a mass marketing campaign. Target lists can contain any number and combination of contacts, leads, targets, users, and accounts. You have the option to associate existing target lists with your new campaign or to create new target lists during the campaign creation process.</p><p>The target list type determines some specific functionality within the campaign. The available target list types are "Default", "Seed", "Suppression List", and "Test". Default and Seed-type target lists will receive emails when campaigns are sent. Test-type target lists will receive emails when campaigns are tested.</p><p>Sugar will also create some target lists for you by default. For example, when selecting a campaign type of "Newsletter", Sugar automatically generates three target lists for the campaign: default-type "Subscription List", suppression by ID-type "Unsubscription List", and test-type "Test List". Please note that these three target list types are required for the Newsletter campaign. You may add additional target list types to the campaign as necessary. If you wish to remove the system generated target list types (e.g. suppression by ID-type "Unsubscription List"), please keep in mind that you must replace it with the same target list type (e.g. Suppression List - By Id).</p><p>For more information about target lists, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Target_Lists">Target Lists</a> documentation.</p><p>Use the following steps to add an existing target list to your campaign via the Target List subpanel on the Campaigns detail view:</p><ol><li>Navigate to the Target List subpanel.</li><li>Choose "Select" from the Actions menu.<br /><strong>Note</strong>: Click the Create button if you wish to create a new target list for the campaign.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/4872393c-e637-0951-7c2c-550307033326.png" alt="Campaigns_DetailView_TargetListSubpanel_Select" width="275" height="120" /></li><li>Locate and select the name of the desired target list in the pop-up window.

These links can be embedded into your email template to help you understand how your recipients are using the campaign email. When the link is clicked, it either opens a website, <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Web_To_Lead_Forms">web-to-lead form</a>, or other URL in your recipient's browser. If you choose to create your links as tracker links, then Sugar will log your recipient's clicks by assigning each tracker link a unique key and routing the link through Sugar before loading the final URL in their browser. The click-through results can be reported on and are visible in the Campaign Status section of the Campaigns module. For more information on the Campaign Status page, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Campaigns/#Campaign_Status">Campaign Status</a> section of this documentation. A specific type of tracker URL is the opt-out link which allows the recipient to opt out of receiving your campaign emails instead of directing them to another web location.</p><h4 id="e2e0d510-23d5-c3f8-3979-570e8a2b51e4_Creating_Redirect_URLs">Creating Redirect URLs</h4><p>Redirect tracker URLs can appear as text or images in your campaign email and when clicked, will navigate your recipient's browser to the URL of your choice: a page within your organization's website, a targeted advertisement, or even a web-to-lead form where they can provide details that will be saved as a Sugar lead record. For more information on web-to-lead forms, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Web_To_Lead_Forms">Web To Lead Forms</a> documentation. The power of redirect URLs is that on each click they pass through your Sugar instance before arriving at their final destination. This allows the clicks to be tracked by your campaign to provide visibility into how your recipients are responding to the campaign.</p><p>Use the following steps to create a redirect URL via your campaign's detail view:</p><ol><li>Navigate to the Tracker URLs subpanel.</li><li>Click the Create button to create a new tracker URL.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/7066fa04-312e-adbe-189a-5503075eb9fb.png" alt="Campaigns_CreatingRedirectURLs_TrackerURL_Create" width="360" height="112" /></li><li>Enter appropriate values in the fields on the page. All required fields are marked with a red asterisk and must be completed. <br /><strong>Tracker Name</strong> : Enter an internal name for the tracker URL. <br /><strong>Opt-out Link</strong> : Leave this box unchecked. <br /><strong>Tracker URL</strong> : Enter the destination URL where recipients will be directed to after clicking the link in the email.</li><li>Click "Save" to create the tracker URL record. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/86b56c17-20c2-bb12-b94a-550307837f56.png" alt="Campaigns_CreatingRedirectURLs_CampaignTrackers_Save2" width="450" height="154" /></li></ol><p>You can now insert this tracker URL into the email template of your choice.

If an opt-out link is not included in the email template, Sugar will add a default opt-out link to the bottom of your campaign email. When targets click on the Opt-out link, Sugar logs the action for your records and the target receives a message stating they have elected to opt out of receiving future emails. <br /><b>Note</b>:<b></b>The message returned to targets can be modified by changing the LBL_ELECTED_TO_OPTOUT label via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on how to modify labels, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Developer_Tools/Studio">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p><p>For a newsletter-type campaign, they will also be added to the suppression-type list which prevents them from receiving emails for that particular campaign in the future. In the case of an email-type campaign, their email address is marked as "Opted Out" on the target's record (e.g. Contact) to prevent them from receiving emails for any campaign. You must manually add your opt-out link by inserting the tracker URL into the email template via the Email Marketing record. <br /><strong>Note</strong>: Opt-out links for newsletters behave differently than other campaign types. When a target clicks an opt-out for a newsletter type campaign they are removed only from the specific campaign that sent the email. They are still able to receive email from other campaigns. <br />Use the following steps to create an opt-out link via your campaign's detail view:</p><ol><li>Navigate to the Tracker URLs subpanel.</li><li>Click the Create button to create a new tracker URL.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/7066fa04-312e-adbe-189a-5503075eb9fb.png" alt="Campaigns_CreatingRedirectURLs_TrackerURL_Create" width="390" height="122" /></li><li>Enter appropriate values in the fields on the page.

For example, a monthly newsletter campaign will have 12 Email Marketing records created in a year, each one with a different email template with the same target lists. Or, if you wish to send an introductory email to all of your newest prospects every 3 months, this email-type campaign will have 4 Email Marketing records created in a year, each one using the same email template but different target lists.

Knowing how many of your targets saw your email, clicked its links, and became leads or contacts, for example, can provide insight for your campaign strategy. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/46340397-9471-5962-d852-550307e9b242.png" alt="Campaign_Status_Message_Sent_Attempted" width="670" height="116" /></p><p>The following subpanels measure different aspects of your recipient's responses to the campaign or a specific send of the campaign based on your selection in the Filter Chart By dropdown at the top of the page:</p><ul><li><strong>Message Sent/Attempted</strong> : The list of campaign emails that were sent out to targets.</li><li><strong>Viewed Message</strong> : The list of targets who viewed the emails that were delivered. Sugar includes a very small, invisible image in each email. Each time the recipient downloads this image, Sugar records that they viewed the email.</li><li><strong>Click-thru Link</strong> : The list of targets who clicked on a redirect tracker URL in the email. This does not include opt-outs. For more information on redirect tracker URLs, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Campaigns/#Creating_Tracker_URLs">Creating Tracker URLs</a> section.</li><li><strong>Leads Created</strong> : The list of leads who have been generated from a web-to-lead form assigned to this campaign record.</li><li><strong>Contacts Created</strong> : The list of contacts who have been converted from a lead generated from a web-to-lead form assigned to this campaign record.</li><li><strong>Bounced Messages, Invalid Email </strong>: The list of campaign emails that bounced back due to invalid email addresses.</li><li><strong>Bounced Messages, Other</strong> : The list of campaign emails that failed to send despite having valid email addresses. After six failed attempts, these messages will be removed from the queue.</li><li><strong>Opted Out</strong> : The list of targets who chose to opt out of receiving campaign emails by clicking the opt-out link. <br /><strong>Note</strong>: Opt-out links for newsletter-type and email-type campaigns behave differently. When a target clicks an opt-out for a newsletter-type campaign, they are prevented from receiving future emails from that specific campaign by being added to the campaign's suppression-type list. When clicking an opt-out for an email-type campaign, they are prevented from receiving future emails from any campaign by having their email address marked as "Opted Out" on their Sugar record.</li><li><strong>Suppressed by Email Address or domain</strong> : The list of email addresses which were not sent the campaign email because they had previously opted out, were a member of a suppression list, or were invalid addresses.</li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: If you do not see the campaign response subpanels, the administrator may have disabled the Campaign Log subpanels for your entire Sugar instance.

Once the search is performed, the relevant search results will be displayed in the Campaigns list view below. Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Please note that Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %offer). This will pull up any record that has the word "offer" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p><p>For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the Search documentation.</p><h3 id="e2e0d510-23d5-c3f8-3979-570e8a2b51e4_Basic_Search">Basic Search</h3><p>Basic search offers a few, commonly used fields for a simplified search experience.

As a case is opened, worked on, and resolved, its progress will be denoted by the Status field. Each case record may relate to other Sugar records such as calls, contacts, and bugs, making it easy to get the full picture of a customer's issues and history. If enabled, contacts can view and open cases via the Sugar Portal along with bugs and knowledge base articles. Cases can also be automatically created from incoming emails, and a case macro can be employed to automatically relate emails to existing cases. This documentation will cover information and actions specific to the Cases module.

Support representatives can CC the address when corresponding with customers to have the emails automatically archived and related to the case in Sugar. Please note that if the account is configured to not automatically import emails, the relationship to the case will not be formed until a user imports it from the group inbox in the Emails module. //mention on Admin Emails documentation.

Once configured, an email address will be generated that is specific to your instance of Sugar. When this email address receives an email, it scans the email for any email addresses. The email is then imported into Sugar, where the email is associated to any contact, lead, etc. containing an email address on the email. When a case macro is included in the email's subject, Sugar will also relate the email to the referenced case.

For knowledge base consumers within your organization who are Sugar users, publishing also changes the article's status and designates that version as the active revision, making it available in the knowledge base list view until a subsequent revision is published. This enables your internal users to access knowledge base content within Sugar by browsing the Knowledge Base Categories &amp; Published Articles dashlet or the Knowledge Base list view.</p></div><p>Articles can be published manually or scheduled to be published automatically on a future date.

Each article can belong to one category, and a category can have many articles. Categories can also have child or parent categories, allowing for a hierarchical structure of categories and sub-categories. Categories can be viewed in the Categories list view and in the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Knowledge_Base/#Viewing_Published_Articles_by_Category">Knowledge Base Categories &amp; Published Articles dashlet</a>. Clicking on a category's hyperlink in the Knowledge Base list view or an article's record view will open a drawer containing all articles belonging to that category, providing a convenient way to view and open articles. Alternatively, you can directly filter the Knowledge Base list view for a particular category.

Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Project Tasks list view below. Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Please note that Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %services). This will pull up any record that has the word "create" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p><p>For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Search">Search</a> documentation. <br /><strong>Note</strong>: Project Tasks is hidden from Global Search by default.

To split filters into multiple groups, use the Add Filter Group button.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d28b0724-83fa-4efd-bcdc-55028a35be58.png" alt="Add_Filter_Group" width="169" height="94" /></p><p>When you have more than one filter group and click a new filter field, Sugar will prompt for which filter group the new field should belong.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/4b5a4375-a447-bd7f-2639-55028a74ae03.png" alt="Add_to_Filter" width="173" height="179" /></p><p>Filter groups and operators can be combined to achieve complex filtering situations. For example, if we need a report for documents belonging to accounts created prior to the first quarter where the document is either new this week or new this month if connected to a lead, we wou ld use the following filter groups with an OR operator joining the two together: <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/50fc0a16-2c81-2712-869e-55028d923872.png" alt="DefineFilters_With_Group1" width="600" height="289" /></p><h4 id="e2ee650e-80c1-9941-e69b-570e8a32b9c9_Filters_on_Tag_Fields">Filters on Tag Fields</h4><p>If a report's target module contains the Tags field, the report can be filtered by tags via the Related Modules filters. To filter by tags, click on the Tags module name in the Related Modules list. The Available Fields list below will display fields belonging to the Tags module. Select the Name field to create a tag filter. Please note that you can select any field(s) from the Tags module as a filter for your report, but this example will only demonstrate filtering by the tag's name. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/20d7b7d4-58a6-5e5a-7350-55d396ffdf55.png" alt="tag-report-filter" width="600" height="266" /></p><p>After clicking on the Name field, a line item will appear in the Filters view that allows you to select an operator and specify a tag name in its adjacent text field. This text field is not a type-ahead style like the Tags field is in the Sidecar modules and can only contain a single tag phrase (e.g. tradeshow, hot lead). Therefore, you must know the precise spelling of the tag name that you wish to use as a filter. </p><p>To filter a report by more than one tag, click on the Name field again for each additional tag. This will produce additional filter rows where you can specify the appropriate operator and its corresponding tag. In the following example, the report will display a list of account records that are tagged with any one or more of the three specified tags (manufacturing, laser, or hot prospect). <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b61a0bb2-f372-d4de-5eb4-55d3a9438f19.png" alt="filter-any" width="600" height="130" /></p><p>In the next example, choosing "AND" as the operator means the report will only display accounts that meet all of the specified criteria:</p><ul><li>The account is tagged "manufacturing".</li><li>The account is tagged with a tag that contains the term "laser" such as "laser processing" or "high-speed laser".</li><li>The account has not been tagged with any tag that contains the term "edu" such as "education" or "educator".<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/54c5d4d1-bea7-443b-6342-55d3a7e0de5a.png" alt="tag-lasermanu" width="600" height="126" /></li></ul><p>When the Tags field is used as a related-module display column in a <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Reports/#Rows_and_Columns">Rows and Columns</a> report or <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Reports/#Summation_Report_with_Details">Summation Report with Details</a>, the Tags column will display a separate line item for each tag that a record contains. For example, an account tagged as both "manufacturing" and "laser" will be displayed twice in an Accounts report if the report displays the Tags column. Also, note that the Tag column will only display a single tag even if the record contains multiple tags. This will be the tag that matches the filter criteria.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/874ec062-c347-af99-d148-55d3b95ecd15.png" alt="tag-reportdupes" width="600" height="119" /></p><p>Please note that clicking on a hyperlinked tag name from report results will take you to the tag's record view. For more information on tags in Sugar, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Tags">Tags</a> documentation in the Application guide.</p><h4 id="e2ee650e-80c1-9941-e69b-570e8a32b9c9_Filters_on_Date_and_Datetime_Fields">Filters on Date and Datetime Fields</h4><p>When creating reports in Sugar, specifying a range of time is a useful way to isolate your desired results. Sugar provides a set of pre-defined options to help you easily target the most common date ranges:</p><table cellpadding="4" border="1" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Date Range Filter</strong></td><td><strong>Definition</strong></td></tr><tr><td>On</td><td>A specific day</td></tr><tr><td>Before</td><td>Any value before the specified date</td></tr><tr><td>After</td><td>Any value after the specified date</td></tr><tr><td>Is Between</td><td>Any values after a specified start date but before a specified end date</td></tr><tr><td>Not On</td><td>Any values except the specified date</td></tr><tr><td>Is Empty</td><td>No date set for the field</td></tr><tr><td>Is Not Empty</td><td>Any date set for the field</td></tr><tr><td>Yesterday</td><td>A value set to the prior day</td></tr><tr><td>Today</td><td>A value set to the current day</td></tr><tr><td>Tomorrow</td><td>A value set to the following day</td></tr><tr><td>Last # Days</td><td>Any values within the last X days including the current day</td></tr><tr><td>Next # Days</td><td>Any values within the next X days including the current day</td></tr><tr><td>Last 7 Days</td><td>Any values within the last 7 days including the current day (e.g. Running on Monday includes the previous Tuesday morning through the end of the current Monday)</td></tr><tr><td>Next 7 Days</td><td>Any values within the next 7 days including current day (e.g. Running on Monday includes the the current Monday morning through the end the following Sunday)</td></tr><tr><td>Last Month</td><td>Any values that fall within the prior calendar month</td></tr><tr><td>This Month</td><td>Any values that fall within the current calendar month</td></tr><tr><td>Next Month</td><td>Any values that fall within the next calendar month</td></tr><tr><td>Last 30 Days</td><td>Any values within the last 30 calendar days including the current day</td></tr><tr><td>Next 30 Days</td><td>Any values within the next 30 calendar days including the current day</td></tr><tr><td>Last Quarter</td><td>Any values within the prior quarter defined by the calendar year (e.g. January - March, April - June, etc.)</td></tr><tr><td>This Quarter</td><td>Any values within the current quarter defined by the calendar year (e.g. January - March, April - June, etc.)</td></tr><tr><td>Next Quarter</td><td>Any values within the upcoming quarter defined by the calendar year (e.g. January - March, April - June, etc.)</td></tr><tr><td>Last Year</td><td>Any values within the prior calendar year</td></tr><tr><td>This Year</td><td>Any values within the current calendar year</td></tr><tr><td>Next Year</td><td>Any values within the upcoming calendar year</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Additionally, if your administrator has configured the Forecasts module via Admin &gt; Forecasts, additional options based on your organization's fiscal year will be available. If your fiscal year follows a traditional calendar year, these options will function in the same way as the corresponding options above:</p><table cellpadding="4" border="1" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Date Range Filter</strong></td><td><strong>Definition</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Previous Fiscal Year</td><td>Any values within the prior fiscal year</td></tr><tr><td>Previous Fiscal Quarter</td><td>Any values within the prior quarter defined by the fiscal year</td></tr><tr><td>Current Fiscal Year</td><td>Any values within the current fiscal year</td></tr><tr><td>Current Fiscal Quarter</td><td>Any values within the current quarter defined by the fiscal year</td></tr><tr><td>Next Fiscal Year</td><td>Any values within the upcoming fiscal year</td></tr><tr><td>Next Fiscal Quarter</td><td>Any values within the upcoming quarter defined by the fiscal year</td></tr></tbody></table><p>For more information about configuring the Forecasting module, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Forecast">Forecast Configuration</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>When generating reports with datetime filters, Sugar will always adjust the results to ensure they are accurate according to the time zone settings of the user accessing the report. For instance, a user on Eastern Standard Time (-5 GMT) may see a different set of results for a report than a user on Pacific Standard Time (-8 GMT) because the date ranges are adjusted for the user's time zone.</p><h3 id="e2ee650e-80c1-9941-e69b-570e8a32b9c9_Report_Display_Columns">Report Display Columns</h3><p>The display columns step allows users to select which field(s) they would like included when generating the report. The system will pull data specific to these fields based on the report criteria for the associated module record. When you select a field from the Available Fields list, they will be added to the right of the list with the displayed path of the field (e.g. Contacts &gt; Assigned to User &gt; User Name). The displayed field paths show users where the field is originating from to retrieve the value for the report. For example, although "Email Address" appears as a field in several modules (e.g. Accounts, Contacts, Leads, etc.), email addresses are actually stored in their own table and are related to the modules where they appear as opposed to being direct fields of those modules. So, the corresponding displayed path will show the primary module record, then the related module followed by the field name (e.g. Contacts &gt; Email Address &gt; Email Address) since the email address field is a field of the related Email Address module.</p><p>To remove any unecessary fields from the display column list, simply click the "-" sign to the far right of the displayed field path row.</p><h4 id="e2ee650e-80c1-9941-e69b-570e8a32b9c9_Changing_Display_Column_Labels">Changing Display Column Labels</h4><p>By default, the selected display column fields will display stock labels which can be changed if you desire. To change the label, simply enter in the new label name in the open text field then click outside of the text box to preserve the change. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d6c8444f-fd76-ae0d-14ff-55028db6fb1d.png" alt="Changing_Label" width="511" height="89" /></p><h4 id="e2ee650e-80c1-9941-e69b-570e8a32b9c9_Changing_Display_Column_Order">Changing Display Column Order</h4><p>You can change the left-to-right order of the display columns by dragging and dropping the displayed field paths in the Choose Display Columns section.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/95004b1d-a1cd-e301-103d-55028d6ae326.png" alt="Change_Display_Column_Order" width="489" height="124" /></p><h4 id="e2ee650e-80c1-9941-e69b-570e8a32b9c9_Defining_Column_Sort">Defining Column Sort</h4><p>You can also designate the generated report to be sorted by a specific field column in either ascending or descending order. Simply mark the radio button next to the field label then select "Ascending" or "Descending" in the corresponding dropdown list. Please note that only one display column can be designated to sort by default in the report.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/4aa05a64-e3c0-c888-0498-55028d452bbe.png" alt="Defining_ColumnSort" width="606" height="149" /></p><h3 id="e2ee650e-80c1-9941-e69b-570e8a32b9c9_Optional_Related_Modules">Optional Related Modules</h3><p>The Optional Related Modules option will appear on the Report Details step if you add fields from related modules to the display column. Please note that if you want your report to include records whether or not they have data in the fields, you will need to mark the displayed module relationship(s) in the Optional Related Modules section. For example, if you add the email address field as a display column for the New Leads report, the Optional Related Modules section will display "Leads &gt; Email Address". Check the box for the Email Address relationship in order to include all applicable results even if the lead record does not contain an email address. By default, Sugar treats all related modules in a report as mandatory meaning that an email address will be required for a lead record to be included.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/3c2facc7-4178-a863-e4f0-55028a38a42e.png" alt="ReportDetails_OptionalRelatedModules" width="529" height="237" /></p><p>Leaving this box unchecked will exclude all lead records from your report that do not have an email address associated with them.</p><p>This holds true for all related modules. You will need to check the box for any relationship you do not wish to be treated as mandatory when Sugar is generating your report. In order to report on records with no related records of a particular module (e.g. Contacts without a related Account) using a filter such as Contacts &gt; Accounts &gt; Name &gt; Is Empty, the Optional Related Modules will also need to be checked.</p><h3 id="e2ee650e-80c1-9941-e69b-570e8a32b9c9_Show_Query">Show Query</h3><p>The Show Query option is only visible to system administrators and displays as a checkbox on the Report Details step.

You have the option of duplicating the report as the original report type that you are currently viewing or any of the other three report types.</p><p>The following steps cover creating a report by duplicating an existing Rows and Columns-type report as an example:</p><ol><li>Navigate to a report's detail view.</li><li>Click the Actions menu and select "Duplicate".</li><li>Choose the report type you would like the duplicated report to be. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/2f20dea4-fbcd-67cf-4757-55028d707a1c.png" alt="ActionsMenu_Duplicate" width="224" height="199" /></li><li>Go through the Report Wizard to select and enter new data as necessary then enter a new name for the report and save. <ul><li>Please note that if you select a report type other than the original type, there may be additional or less steps in the Report Wizard to complete and you may need to edit the report as necessary to meet the specific report type requirements.</li></ul></li></ol><h2 id="e2ee650e-80c1-9941-e69b-570e8a32b9c9_Scheduling_Reports">Scheduling Reports</h2><p>Reports in Sugar can be scheduled to be emailed to users periodically based on specified date and time intervals. Please note that each individual user has to schedule the report in their Sugar account in order for the reports to be delivered to them. Sugar will run the report at the specified interval based on the set time zone in user preferences and sends it as a PDF file to your email address on file. Please note that the outbound mail server for the system as well as the user's email settings must be configured properly in order for the reports to be delivered successfully. For more information on setting up the system email settings, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Email">Email</a> documentation in the Administration guide. For more information on setting up your user preferences' email settings, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Getting_Started">Getting Started</a> documentation.</p><p>The Run Report Generation Scheduled Tasks scheduler in Sugar processes all scheduled reports to be delivered to the user at the scheduled interval. By default, the report scheduler is set as "Inactive" for new Sugar installations. Administrators must check to make sure that the Run Report Generation Scheduled Tasks scheduler is active and the settings (e.g. interval) are configured properly. F or example, if the scheduler is set to trigger once per day and a user schedules a report to be delivered every hour, the report will only be delivered once each day due to the set interval in the scheduler. The administrator must change the interval for the scheduler to run every 1 hour in order for the users report to be processed and delivered per their scheduled interval.For more information on configuring schedulers, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/System/Schedulers">Schedulers</a> section of the System documentation.</p><h3 id="e2ee650e-80c1-9941-e69b-570e8a32b9c9_Scheduling_Via_Detail_View">Scheduling Via Detail View</h3><p>Use the following steps to schedule the report via the detail view:</p><ol><li>Navigate to a report's detail view.</li><li>Select "Schedule" from the Actions menu. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/844a012e-5e85-bc86-e1df-55028a4fb737.png" alt="Report_Schedule" width="131" height="189" /></li><li>Enter the start date/time and select the time interval for report delivery.

These targets are typically identified based on a set of predetermined criteria such as being a prospect or existing customer, age group, industry, etc. The Reports module gives users the ability to add a large number of records (e.g. Contacts, Leads, Accounts, etc.) to a target list at once instead of selecting them one-by-one. For example, if you need to add all leads in the state of California to your target list, you can create a report based on the Leads module filtered by the Primary Address State field (e.g. CA). Once the report is created and saved, you can navigate to the Target Lists module to add the report results to the specific target list. Go down to the Leads subpanel in the Target List's detail view, click the Actions menu, then choose "Select from Reports". Select the saved lead report from the pop-up window and all lead records from the selected report will be added to the target list.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/4cc219fd-e0c0-c32a-fd1f-55028ae90890.png" alt="Leads_Subpanel" width="402" height="109" /></p><p>For more information on adding records to target lists, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Target_Lists">Target Lists</a> documentation.

Although the Reports module may be used to create many kinds of reports, users with SQL knowledge may use advanced reports to craft direct database queries for more flexible and extensible reporting. </p><p>Advanced reports are a combination of three related modules:</p><ul><li><strong>Custom Queries</strong> : Custom query records contain the SQL statement used to pull information from the database.</li><li><strong>Data Formats</strong> : Data format records describe how to format and display the results of the related custom query. Data formats may also be interrelated to create child/parent combinations of queries.</li><li><strong>Advanced Reports</strong> : Advanced report records serve as headers for the report and may display one or more data format. The advanced report record may also be scheduled to be automatically run and emailed to a user.</li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: You must be an administrator in order to create, edit, and delete custom queries. Data formats and advanced reports may be created and manipulated by non-admin users according to their team access.

This allows for more complex report results that are displayed in a parent/child format mirroring the queries' relationship. Sugar will first run the parent query, then, for each row of the parent query, it will run the child query.</p><p>Use the following steps to interlock a pair of simple queries as an example:</p><ol><li>Create a custom query record called "All Users Query" with the following SQL statement:<br /> Select id, user_name from users</li><li>Create a second custom query record called "Accounts By Users Query" with the following SQL statement:<br /> Select name, assigned_user_id from accounts where assigned_user_id = '{sub}id{sub}'</li><li>Create a data format record called "All Users Format" with the Query Name field set to "All Users Query".</li><li>Create a data format record called "Accounts By Users Format" with the Query Name field set to "Accounts By Users Query" and the Parent Data Format field set to "All Users Format".</li><li>Create an advanced report record.</li><li>From the advanced report's detail view, use the Select button to choose "All Users Format".</li><li>Click the Run Report button.</li></ol><p>The '{sub}id{sub}' is inserted to the child query to refer to the parent query's current result row. In this example, Sugar will generate a list of user names and id's. Below each user row, a list of accounts assigned to that particular user will appear. The child query is returning assigned_user_id to help make the functionality clear.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8b3b02b1-bda5-a6c4-412a-5503077ff5ab.png" alt="advrep_parentchildsimple" width="451" height="150" /></p><p>Please note that a child data format cannot be run from it's own record nor added to an advanced report record. Only by running its parent data format or adding its parent data format to a report will the child query's results be displayed.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Only two data formats may be interlocked at a time. Chains of three or more data format records will cause Sugar not to recognize the queries three or more levels deep.</p><h2 id="e2f0a24f-45e5-56d6-2785-570e8ac22cb9_Column-Level_Formatting">Column-Level Formatting</h2><p>Each data format includes formatting options such as color, size, etc which affect the entirety of the custom query's table and header. These options are available while editing the data format record and include these fields. In addition, each column of a query's table may be formatted individually using the options available on the detail view of a data format record. Please note, in order for these options to be available, the related custom query must be returning at least one row.</p><h3 id="e2f0a24f-45e5-56d6-2785-570e8ac22cb9_Formatting_a_Columns_Header">Formatting a Column's Header</h3><p>Once you have created a data format record including choosing a custom query record which will return at least one row of data, a table will be displayed at the bottom of the data format record's detail view.

This export will not include any information from records which are associated via relationships to this module. Please note that the export method varies slightly between modules using the Sidecar user interface (e.g. Accounts, Contacts, Leads, etc.) and Legacy user interface (e.g. Calls, Meetings, Quotes, etc.).</p><p>This export method is most useful when performing a type of data migration, needing an excess of detail, or performing a comprehensive import and update of the data, since this method exports all fields within a module.

When viewed in a plain text editor, a CSV file looks like a long string of text with groupings of text separated with quotation marks and commas (e.g. "First Name","Last Name","Title"). The file first lists out all columns that are in the file, and then the corresponding rows follow, also separated by quotation marks and commas (e.g. "Dusty","Connor","IT Developer").</p><p>However, most spreadsheet software, such as Microsoft Excel, will read this file and convert the quotation marks and commas into rows and columns.

Using a Rows and Columns report, users can select the specific fields they would like to see on the export file and filter the module data however they would like. The advantage to using reports is that users will only be presented with the data that they need, and no excess data.

Depending on your business needs, you may run imports anywhere from multiple times per week to only once or twice per year. Regardless of the import frequency, all users follow the same import guidelines:</p><ul><li><strong>File Delimitation : </strong>Sugar accepts files that are delimited by a given separator, such as commas or tabs. The most common type of import will be using a CSV (Comma Separate Value) file, but Sugar will accept other file types as long as it recognizes the delimiter.</li><li><strong>Imposed Limitations : </strong>Sugar, by default, does not impose any type of import imitations. However, System Administrators can impose a limit on the amount of rows or records that can be imported at one time. This limitation is found in Admin &gt; System Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Import - Maximum Number of Rows. Administrators can also limit what modules users are allowed to import into through the use of <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Role_Management">Roles</a>.</li><li><strong>Scrub Data Before Import : </strong>It is strongly recommended that all data is reviewed and scrubbed before importing. It is much easier to see if you are importing good data or that you have removed all duplicates before importing than finding them after they are already in Sugar and are already in use by other users. In addition, you want to ensure standardized fields such as dates, phone numbers, etc. adhere to a common format so that the import will run as smooth as possible.</li><li><strong>Parent Records First :</strong> When importing any records that use a relationship to another module, such as the Account - Contact relationship, it is best to try importing the parent, or higher level, records first. This is demonstrated with a one-to-many relationship between the two modules. In this case, it is best to import accounts first and then contacts, which rely on account records.</li></ul><h2 id="e2f723c9-7373-cfec-586b-570e8adfa224_Importing_New_Records">Importing New Records</h2><p>The first type of import that will be covered is importing new records. Whether you are just starting a migration from another CRM to Sugar or if you are adding a new list of records that you have received, such as a new list of leads or accounts, this process will help to get the data into Sugar without having to manually enter each record. After preparing your import file, follow these steps to import the list into Sugar:</p><ol><li>Navigate to the module tab for the module that you are importing into and select the import option. This will open the Import Wizard and bring you to the"Upload Import File" screen. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/2576ee9a-8753-17da-21b3-550286362b17.png" alt="import_accounts_mt_67" width="207" height="208" /></li><li>If you would like to review the Import File Template, you can download it from this page. This will give you a template of the format Sugar is going to be using to import your data. For more information on the template, please review the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Import/#Import_File_Template">Import File Template</a> section of this documentation.</li><li>Select the import file that you are going to use to import by clicking the Choose File button. When prompted, select the file from your computer and it will appear in this box. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a8a1937a-5bad-753b-0996-5502863d2d97.png" alt="Choose_file" height="43" width="409" /></li><li>Ensure that "Create new records only" is selected.</li><li>If you have preformed imports before and have previously saved your import settings, you can select your setting at the bottom of the page using the "To use pre-set import settings, select from below" option. If you do not have any saved import settings, this section will not appear.

If you notice any mistakes or need to set up any advanced configuration, click "View Import File Properties". These changes are specific to the import and do not affect your standard user preferences. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/1449420a-00c5-2a0d-3fb8-5502861ef593.png" width="600" height="240" alt="Import_Property_panel_67" /></li><li>If the file was exported from either Salesforce.com or Microsoft Outlook, select the corresponding option under "If the import file data was exported from any of the following sources, select which one". If not, leave this as "None". This option will set up your mapping properly on the next screen.</li><li>Click "Next" to access the Confirm Field Mappings screen.</li><li>Click the View Notes button for any relevant information, specific to this module, to the import that you are performing. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/9a581684-0331-f1cc-1bee-550286bae868.png" width="138" height="127" alt="view_notes_button_mapping_67" /></li><li>This screen presents you with four columns: <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b56a8312-0f52-527e-a82d-5502863d2588.png" alt="four_columns_67" width="572" height="63" /></li></ol><ul><li><strong>Header Row : </strong>This is the column header from your import file. This column will let you reference your file to make sure your column mapping is correct. If your import file does not have a header row, this column will not show.</li><li><strong>Module Field : </strong>This column contains a dropdown list of all importable fields for the module. The Import Wizard tries to match the Header Row with the corresponding Sugar field. If the suggested mapping is incorrect, use the dropdown list to change the mapping. Required fields are marked with an asterisk (*).</li><li><strong>Row 1 : </strong>This column contains the values from the first row of data in your import file. This is another aid to help ensure you have your mapping correct, so that you can see the mapping using real data and not just the headers. If your import file does not have column headers, there will be an additional column for Row 2.</li><li><strong>Default Value : </strong>This column is hidden by default, but can be expanded if needed. When expanded, you have the option to fill in a value that will populate all records where a value for that field does not exist. For example, if you do not have anything populated in the Accounts Industry field, but you know this is a list of Technology companies, you can populate all blank values in the Industry field with the value of "Technology"<strong>. </strong></li><li>Click "Add Field" if any data needs to be added to the import that is not on your import file. This can be used if you would like to assign a value to a record when the column is not on your import file. This is used in conjunction with the Default Value column. For example, if you are importing these accounts, but would like to assign them all to another user, John Smith, you would click the Add Field button, select the field from the Module Field column, and populate the desired value in the Default Value column. Now, all records will be assigned to John Smith upon import. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/1462cd0b-dc05-4abe-1ed4-550286a30007.png" width="647" height="331" alt="add_field_to_mapping_67" /></li><li>Click "Next" to access the Check for Possible Duplicates screen.</li><li>This menu allows users to check if there are duplicated values on the import to records that already exist in Sugar. This menu will vary depending on what module you are importing into as the fields will be specific to this module. The fields available to the Import Wizard are determined based off the system-defined indexes. This is why you will not see all fields shown on this list, but only a subset of fields from the module. If you would like to cross reference existing Sugar records against what is being imported, simply drag and drop the field name from the right column, "Available Fields", to the left column, "Fields to Check".

The process runs very similar to the new record import process described above.</p><p>The most important aspect to importing updates to existing records is that Sugar will only update records where there is a matching ID in the import file. Every Sugar record, regardless of what module it is in, is defined with an alphanumeric ID field. This field is typically a 36-character alphanumeric value but may be less if imported from a previous CRM. This field is the only way that the Import Wizard will know which record to update.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>All other fields (name, email address, etc.) are not considered unique and can have duplicates, so only the ID field will work to differentiate records for an update from import.</p><p>The ID field is not usually shown within Sugar and must be found either by running a report or an export within the module.</p><p>During the import, if there are any other records without ID fields and they are on the import file, they will create new records, which will create duplicates in your database.</p><p>To import updates, follow the steps below.</p><ol><li>To prepare the import file, you must have the ID numbers for all of the records that you are going to be updating. The most common methods are either by exporting a list of records from the module list view, or by running a report and exporting the results. For more information on exporting, please review the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Export">Export</a> documentation. <ul><li><strong>Export from List View :</strong> This option will include the record ID field, but it is recommended that you open the file in a spreadsheet editor (Microsoft Excel) and delete any columns that you are not updating. Be sure to leave the ID field and any required fields, such as Name, as the import will not complete without these.</li><li><strong>Export from Report : </strong>If you choose to run a report, be sure to include the ID field in your display columns so that the records can be matched up. You will also want to include any required fields, such as Name, as the import will not complete without these. Please note that only Rows and Columns reports can be used for exports. <br />After you have your file ready for import, you can proceed with working through the Import Wizard.</li></ul></li><li>Navigate to the module tab for the module that you are updating and select the import option. This will open the Import Wizard and bring you to the<strong> "</strong>Upload Import File" screen. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/2576ee9a-8753-17da-21b3-550286362b17.png" alt="import_accounts_mt_67" width="207" height="208" /></li><li>If you would like to review the Import File Template, you can download it from this page.

For example, a multiselect field for Flavors contains the options Chocolate, Pistachio, Rocky Road, Spumoni, and Vanilla.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/dc911dfc-56dd-118d-d4a8-550286c48f79.png" alt="multiselect-values" width="242" height="223" /><br />To import a new record that contains both "Vanilla" and "Chocolate" in the Flavors field, the import data file's Flavors column should contain <code>Vanilla,Chocolate</code> with a comma separating the values and no extra spaces. If one of the imported multiselect options is a phrase, such as "Rocky Road", then the imported data field should contain a space character only within that value: <code>Vanilla,Chocolate,Rocky Road</code>.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b2fbaa6d-53f8-c2e6-9bd7-550286100856.png" alt="multiselect-import" width="418" height="130" /></p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The dropdown option display labels are not required to be unique, so best practice is to import the database values if they are known.

If you wish to append new values to the existing values via import, you must first export the contents of the field for each record you will be updating, add the desired values to the existing values in by modifying the exported CSV file, then import the modified export file to Sugar.</p><p>For example, imagine you would like to update 100 existing contact records. Each of the 100 contacts should have "Chocolate" added to the multiselect field "Flavors" without losing the data that is stored in the multiselect field already. The following steps explain how to append a multiselect field via import:</p><ol><li>Export the list of 100 contacts that need to be updated.</li><li>Preserve (at least) the Last Name, ID, and Flavors fields in the export file. The other field columns may be deleted.</li><li>Sort the spreadsheet data by the Flavors column.</li><li>Remove any rows from the file that already contain "Chocolate" as a value in the Flavors column.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/80252e70-03fd-460c-df73-5502867ba7e5.png" alt="remove-import-rows" width="463" height="288" /></li><li>If the Flavors column contains any empty cells, type the word <code>Chocolate</code> in those cells.

A common example of this would be how importing contacts without an account name would leave the contacts orphaned and not linked to any parent account. To solve this problem, Sugar allows one-to-many and one-to-one relationships to be imported during the standard import process. The available fields will vary depending on the module being imported and will show on the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Import/#Import_File_Template">Import Template</a>.</p><div><p>Please note that when an opportunity is imported into Sugar, a revenue line item must also be imported and related to the opportunity in order to populate the amounts (e.g. best, likely, etc.) on the opportunity record. Be sure to include the opportunity ID and amounts on the revenue line item import file.</p></div><p>When importing a relationship, Sugar will need the related record's unique ID, or, in some cases, will accept the record's Name field.

The template for any module can be found on the Upload Import File page, which is either the first or second page of the wizard, depending on the module.</p><p>The purpose of this file is to let you know what format Sugar is going to be looking for when you perform your import. The file contains all fields for a given module, regardless of if they show on any of your layouts. The file is also properly formatted and all settings are ready for the import. Upon opening the template, you will see a few example lines of either actual records from your instance, or, "demo data" if you have not yet performed an import.

When enabled, Sugar will check to see if a record already exists in Sugar with the given criteria. When checking for duplicates, Sugar will mark any record as a duplicate if it cross references against any of the duplicate fields. For example, when importing Contacts, if you select Last Name and Email Address as your duplicate check fields, any record that has a matching last name and/or a matching email address to an existing contact in Sugar will be marked as a duplicate.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/dd8eb20c-b75c-ddf4-bb7a-550286814a44.png" alt="Contact_Dupe_Check" height="145" width="506" /></p><p>The duplicate check fields used in each module differ depending on what fields are available to the module. Not all fields are used or available in the duplicate check and are pre-determined based off of system-defined indexes.</p><p>If your import file has any duplicate records based off the fields you elect to verify against, the first record will be imported, and then all subsequent records in the file matching the duplicate criteria will be flagged.</p><p>Any duplicates will show as such on the final page of the import. You will also have an option to download the duplicates so that they can be manually cross-referenced to verify if they are actually duplicates. If they are not, simply re-run the import process without selecting any fields on the "Check for Possible Duplicates" page.</p><h2 id="e2f723c9-7373-cfec-586b-570e8adfa224_External_Data_Sources">External Data Sources</h2><p>When importing data to Sugar, there are other options than importing a data file exported from another source.

Sugar stores tags as individual records in the Tags module. Modules (e.g. Accounts, Contacts, etc.) using the Sidecar user interface contain a Tags field where users can create and share tags that can be used to identify records in filters, dashlets, and reports.</p><p>Users can easily create tags from any tags-enabled module's (e.g. contact's) record view. Once the tag is created, it may then be related to other Sugar records such as meetings, cases, opportunities, and many others. One Sugar record can have multiple tags. This documentation will cover how users can create new tags and use existing tags by interacting with the system-wide tag repository.</p><p>While tags can be created and used by regular Sugar users, some actions in the Tags module are only available to administrators and users with developer-level role access. This documentation will cover the actions available to all users. For information about tag administration options which allow you to manage the system-wide tag repository, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Tag_Management">Tag Management</a> documentation in the Administration Guide.

For more information on access types and roles, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Administration_Guide/Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p><h3 id="e2fdb5dc-323c-93c8-8e8c-570e8a1975dd_Understanding_Tag_Behavior">Understanding Tag Behavior</h3><p>The act of relating a tag to a Sugar record is referred to as "tagging". A user can tag any Sidecar module record in Sugar via the Tags field. Please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/User_Interface">User Interface</a> documentation for a list of Sidecar modules. If you do not see the Tags field but expect that you should, reach out to your system administrator to discuss tag visibility and access settings for your user.</p><p>Use cases for effective tagging include:</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Use Case</strong></td><td><strong>Example Tags</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Classifying high-value or urgent business</td><td><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/1f50008a-6c47-e5bd-7f0f-55028601654e.png" alt="hot-tags" width="224" height="49" /></td></tr><tr><td>Connecting specific events and activities with clients</td><td><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e5e437cd-bda5-0a4a-c167-550286476ab4.png" alt="event-tags" width="321" height="48" /></td></tr><tr><td>Assigning role-based attributes</td><td><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b68df691-2f7c-f225-3e64-550286e7d2ef.png" alt="role-tags" width="340" height="46" /></td></tr><tr><td>Noting interest-based and demographic classifications</td><td><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8bdca74d-4e36-6ba9-1628-550286fb556e.png" alt="interest-tags" width="332" height="54" /></td></tr></tbody></table><p>When working with tags in Sugar, keep in mind the following rules of tag behavior:</p><ul><li>Tags may be a single word or a short phrase.</li><li>Differentiate between single-word tags and multi-word phrases by using a comma between tags.</li><li>Inserting a space character will result in a single, multi-word tag.</li><li>Tags are not case-sensitive, but take care to prevent unintentional duplicates due to misspellings or unnecessary punctuation.</li><li>Tags are shared by every user in an instance and across all tags-enabled modules.

Deselect this option to overwrite all existing data in the Tags field of the selected records.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/7f0f56b2-15ec-143e-7d8b-55b004faae2a.png" alt="append" width="130" height="46" /></li><li>Click "Update" to add the tag to all selected records.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/ce100e05-a7d1-8513-fb1c-55b00836e741.png" alt="saved-tags" width="600" height="102" /></li></ol><h3 id="e2fdb5dc-323c-93c8-8e8c-570e8a1975dd_Tagging_Via_Import">Tagging Via Import</h3><p>Users can tag new or existing Sugar records by including the Tags field as a column in an import file. For more information on tagging via import, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Import">Importing Fields With Multiple Values</a> section of the Import documentation. </p><p>Please note that importing an update to the Tags field of a record that already exists in Sugar will erase any previous tags on the record and replace them with the imported tags. For more information on importing tags to existing records, please refer to <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Import">Importing Multiselect Fields to Existing Records</a> in the Import documentation.</p><h4 id="e2fdb5dc-323c-93c8-8e8c-570e8a1975dd_Formatting_Tag_Imports">Formatting Tag Imports</h4><p>Tags are not case sensitive, but they must be entered as an exact character match in the import file when adding existing tags to records in order to prevent creating duplicate variations of the same tag. For example, if there is an existing tag named "rocky road" in Sugar, importing the tag "ROCKY ROAD" as all uppercase will successfully find and relate the existing tag. However, if the import file contains "rocky-road" with a hyphen, an unintentional synonymous tag will be created.</p><p>When importing tags to related module records (e.g. contacts), multiple tags being added to one record should be separated with a comma. For example, to create or update a contact record tagged as both "vanilla" and "chocolate", the import data file's Tags column should contain <code>vanilla,chocolate</code> with a comma separating the tags and no extra spaces between the tags. If one of the imported tags is a multi-word phrase, such as "rocky road", then the imported data field should contain a space character only within that tag value: <code>vanilla,chocolate,rocky road</code>. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/6d2a14fe-49e3-1545-5f4f-5502862320e7.png" alt="import-tags2" width="369" height="64" /></p><p>For more information on importing records with the Tags field, please refer to the <a href="http://http//support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.7/Ent/Application_Guide/Import">Import</a> documentation in the Application Guide.</p><h2 id="e2fdb5dc-323c-93c8-8e8c-570e8a1975dd_Using_Tags_in_Global_Search">Using Tags in Global Search</h2><p>Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting results to a specific module. The Global Search bar displays on the upper right of every Sugar page and utilizes full-text search to search throughout many fields and modules for an enhanced search experience.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/3c10d5ca-b4b9-9dc2-be23-55674add90f9.png" alt="GlobalSearch Bar7.7 2" width="515" height="41" /></p><p>Users can locate and select tags as global search filters to easily locate groups of records that are tagged by common attributes. For example, if you have a set of leads that were acquired from a specific conference (e.g. 2015 Western Conference) and you wish to locate all the lead records tagged with this value, you can perform a search using the tag value. As you type the tag's name, a list of matching tags will appear in the tag ribbon beneath the search box and display up to five matching tags.</p><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/4c031a90-688d-f697-4b79-55dbcd51ed00.png" alt="tag-searchresult" width="450" height="360" /></p><p>Click on the desired tag to apply it as a filter for the Global Search results. You can append additional search terms or tags in the search box to further narrow your search. Simply enter the keyword to the right of the current criteria and the matching result(s) will display below. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a4f6ca57-f31b-b07a-33dd-55dbcd768538.png" alt="tagged-search" width="450" height="241" /></p><p>If you search using multiple tags, the system will look for records that match any one of the tags in the search box using the "or" operator.
