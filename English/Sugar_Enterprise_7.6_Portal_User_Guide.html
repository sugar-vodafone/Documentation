Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Knowledge Base list view below. The Knowledge Base dashlet also includes a search bar to help locate articles. Global Search allows you to search for information across the entire portal, as opposed to restricting search within a specific module.

This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %troubleshooting). This will pull up any record that has the word "troubleshooting" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Only the document's name can be used to search for articles in the portal.
