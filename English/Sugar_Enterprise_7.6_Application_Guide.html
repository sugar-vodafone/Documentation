<h2 id="e-543f-551b22c2c01c_Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Sugar offers users a wide range of configuration options when getting started with the application. Your first time logging into Sugar the New User Wizard will step through configuring some basic settings (i.e. Your Information, Your Locale, etc.). You may skip these steps and configure these settings in your user preferences at a later time. Please note that system administrators can also set up each user's basic settings when creating the user in Sugar. This documentation will cover the various options (e.g. New User Wizard, User Preferences, etc.) available when first getting started with Sugar and accessing your account.</p>
<h2 id="e-543f-551b22c2c01c_Accessing_Sugar">Accessing Sugar</h2>

<h3 id="e-543f-551b22c2c01c_Logging_Out">Logging Out</h3>
<p>When you are done working in Sugar and wish to log out of the system, simply click your user name on the upper right of Sugar and select "Log Out". This will log you out completely from Sugar and you must <a href="#e-543f-551b22c2c01c_Logging_In">log in</a> again in order to access your account.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5091d1f2-48a5-3323-6fb0-550304ecb435.png" alt="" height="167" width="145" /></p>
<h4 id="e-543f-551b22c2c01c_Automatic_Log_Outs">Automatic Log Outs</h4>
<p>While working in Sugar, a user may be automatically logged out of the system. Currently, Sugar allows a username to be logged in under only one session, and any additional user sessions started using the same username will log out the previous session. This behavior is for your security as Sugar does not allow multiple sessions for the same username from different machines or browsers. To prevent situations like this, please do not share your login credentials (username and password) with users in your organization.</p>
<p>Another situation where users are automatically logged out is when the user does not perform any actions in Sugar for a certain period of time. The security timeout period in Sugar is controlled by configuration settings in PHP and the web server running your Sugar instance. Please note that the PHP session's lifetime persists until you close your web browser and the default session timeout value is 1440 seconds (24 minutes).</p>
<p>In order to prevent security timeouts, users can navigate or click the page(s) in Sugar every so often to keep the session active. If the session times out, click any button, tab, etc. on the current page once you are ready to continue working in Sugar, and you will be taken back to the <a href="#e-543f-551b22c2c01c_Logging_In">Login screen</a>. Another option is to completely close your current browser and open a new browser to navigate back to Sugar's Login page.</p>
<p>Please note that users can have multiple tabs of Sugar pages open within the same web browser (e.g. Chrome) without getting logged out of the system. For example, this is useful when working with multiple Sugar pages or records without navigating away from previous pages.</p>
<h2 id="e-543f-551b22c2c01c_New_User_Wizard">New User Wizard</h2>
<p>When users first log in to Sugar, they will step through the New User Wizard to configure some basic settings (i.e. Your Information, Your Locale, etc.). If the system administrator already configured your basic settings when adding you as a user to Sugar, the fields in the wizard will be populated with the provided information. You can update your information as you go through the New User Wizard to make any necessary changes. Please note that you can skip the steps in the wizard if you wish to configure the settings via your user preferences at a later time.</p>
<h3 id="e-543f-551b22c2c01c_Configuring_Your_Information">Configuring Your Information</h3>
<p>The Your Information step of the New User Wizard allows you to enter basic information (e.g. name, email address, phone) about yourself to be stored in your user profile. Please note that the information provided on this step can be updated in your user preferences at a later time if desired. For more information on configuring your personal information, please refer to the <a href="#e-543f-551b22c2c01c_User_Preferences">User Preferences</a> section of this documentation.</p>
<p>The following options are available to configure your user profile:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>First Name</strong> : Enter your first name.</li>
    <li><strong>Last Name </strong>: Enter your last name.</li>
    <li><strong>Email</strong> : Enter your primary email address.</li>
    <li><strong>Phone</strong> : Enter your office number.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that all required fields will indicate "Required" in the field and must be completed prior to moving to the next step of the wizard. Once your personal information is entered, click "Next". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/2180fe54-b994-e6ad-d1ab-55030470390f.png" alt="" width="517" height="284" /></p>
<h3 id="e-543f-551b22c2c01c_Configuring_Your_Locale">Configuring Your Locale</h3>
<p>The User Locale Settings step allows you to configure the date, time, and name format you want displayed in Sugar based on your current geographical location. Please note that the information provided on this page can be updated in your <a href="#e-543f-551b22c2c01c_User_Preferences">user preferences</a> at a later time if desired.</p>
<p>The following options are available to configure your locale settings:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Time Zone</strong> : Select the time zone based on your current geographical location.</li>
    <li><strong>Date Format</strong> : Select the format you want the date stamps displayed in Sugar.</li>
    <li><strong>Time Format</strong> : Select the format you want the time stamps displayed in Sugar.</li>
    <li><strong>Name Format </strong>: Select the format you want the concatenated name fields displayed in Sugar's list view and record view.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once your locale information is entered, click "Next". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/422ee1e1-e969-905e-7adc-550304ae6cdc.png" alt="" height="282" width="516" /></p>
<p>The following page will confirm that your set up is complete and that you are ready to use Sugar. You can access the various support resources (e.g. Documentation, Knowledge Base, etc.) available by clicking one of the boxes in the dialog box. Please note that you can click "Start Sugar" to go directly into your Sugar account. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/993e12b0-187d-39b6-cdc1-550304994e3d.png" alt="" height="282" width="516" /></p>
<h2 id="e-543f-551b22c2c01c_Tour">Tour</h2>
<p>Upon your first log into Sugar, the Welcome to Sugar tour will launch on the Home page to show you key features of the user interface. The Welcome to Sugar window includes links which provide access to additional resources (e.g. training, documentation, etc.). Click the appropriate link or icon to be directed to the specific page in a separate tab. To begin the tour, simply click the Right arrow and a bubble will appear to point out the various parts of the application such as where to access the dashboard and activity stream, perform a global search, etc. You can click the Left arrow at anytime during the tour to go back through the key features again.

<p>Sugar calendars can be shared and viewed with various iCal compatible calendar applications such as Apple iCal, Google Calendar, Yahoo! Calendar, Mozilla Thunderbird, etc. The calendars are viewable as read-only in the external calendar applications and any edits to existing calendar events (e.g. meetings, calls, etc.) can only be done in Sugar. The Calendar Options section allows users to generate a unique publish key to sync their Sugar calendar to external calendar application(s). The publish key is a security feature as it prevents other user's from viewing your calendar unless they have this information. The user must have your publish key information in order to view your Sugar calendar via the external calendar application.</p>
<ul>
    <li><span>Publish Key :</span> The publish key is used to uniquely identify a user's calendar and sync Sugar's calendar to external calendar applications (e.g. Google Calendar, Apple iCal, etc.). A system-generated alphanumeric value (e.g. 948fc65a-9c89-a11f-b40c-5) is displayed by default, but users can change this key (e.g. mysecretkey) to whatever they wish. The Publish at my location site, Search location, and iCal integration URL all reflect the publish key within the URL.</li>
    <li><strong>Publish at my location</strong> : Use this URL to sync free/busy information for meetings from Microsoft Outlook to Sugar. This is helpful when scheduling meetings in Sugar as you can view the user's free/busy information to avoid scheduling conflicts.</li>
    <li><strong>Search location</strong> : Use this URL to sync free/busy information for meetings from Microsoft Outlook to Sugar. This is helpful when scheduling meetings in Sugar as you can view the user's free/busy information to avoid scheduling conflicts.</li>

<p>Users can view their access information (e.g. Access table, Roles, My Teams) via the Access tab in the detail view of their profile. System administrators can assign users to various teams and roles depending on what each user is allowed access to in Sugar. You will be able to view the team(s) and role(s) assigned to you via the Roles and My Teams section in the Access tab.</p>
<h4 id="e-543f-551b22c2c01c_Access_Table">Access Table</h4>
<p>The Access table summarizes the set of permissions assigned to the user and allows them to view the type of access they have along with the actions (e.g. View, Edit, Delete, etc.) they can perform in Sugar. Only system administrators have the ability to create roles and assign them to users. Users who are assigned to the role will only be able to perform actions defined by it. Please note that users with more than one role assigned will have the more restrictive role setting prevail on the access table. For example, if one role allows the user to delete records in the Contacts module, but the other role does not allow record deletion, the user will not be able to delete records in the Contacts module. The table will list the modules in rows on the far left with column headers representing the type of action (e.g. Delete, Edit, Export, etc.) users can perform in each module. For more information on the Access table column headers, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management#Setting_Module-Level_Permissions">Setting Module-Level Permissions</a> section in the Role Management documentation.</p>
<p>The following setting options are available for the Access column on the table:</p>

<h4 id="e-543f-551b22c2c01c_Roles">Roles</h4>
<p>Sugar Roles define permissions for users such as what kinds of records they can access and what level of access they are allowed . Roles work in conjunction withteams to form a robust security model for non-admin users in Sugar. Roles control three different layers of access for users within Sugar: module, field, and action-level access. Please note that only users who are assigned to the specific role will be able to perform actions (e.g. view, edit, delete, etc.) defined by it. For more information on the various actions and setting options for roles, please refer to the <a href="#e-543f-551b22c2c01c_Access_Table">Access Table</a> section of this documentation. Users who arenot assigned to a role can access and perform actions in any module as long as they are assigned to the record or a member of the team assigned to manage it. System administrators have the ability to create various roles and assign additional roles to users via Admin &gt; Role Management. For more information on creating and assigning roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation.</p>
<p>The Roles section displays the list of roles (if any) assigned to the user. Please note that if you are assigned to more than one role, the more restrictive role setting prevails. For example, if you have two roles where one role allows exporting of records in the Leads module and the other does not, then you will not be able to export lead records due to the more restrictive role setting.<img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/bdcade4f-f1b4-2ae8-d429-550304e36ca4.png" alt="" height="100" width="304" /></p>
<h4 id="e-543f-551b22c2c01c_My_Teams">My Teams</h4>
<p>Teams consist of one or more users who are assigned to manage records in Sugar. The defined permissions determine what records a user is and is not able to access. Teams are used in conjunction withroles to form a robust security model for non-admin users in Sugar. The My Teams section displays the list of teams a user is associated with, which determines what records the user has access to in Sugar. Please note that every record is assigned to at least one team, but can be assigned to multiple teams as well if different users need access to it. The default team(s) set in the User Settings section under the Advanced tabwill automatically be assigned to new records created by the user. Users assigned to the record, as well as system administrators can access the record regardless of team membership. When a user is created in Sugar, they are automatically associated to the Global team (universal team) and a Private team (users own personal team) is created by default. System administrators can assign users to additional teams via Admin &gt; User Management or Admin &gt; Team Management as necessary. For more information on teams as well as creating and assigning teams, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/031_Team_Management">Team Management</a> documentation.<img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5db8a542-71e2-2c68-190b-550304804a62.png" alt="" width="282" height="119" /></p>

<h3 id="f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_Quick_Create">Quick Create</h3>
<p>The Quick Create menu allows you to easily create new records for various modules from anywhere in Sugar. Simply click the Quick Create button on the upper right of any Sugar page to access the menu. Please note that a maximum of ten modules may be enabled to display in the Quick Create menu. Administrators can configure which modules are enabled in the Quick Create menu via Admin &gt; Configure Navigation Bar Quick Create. For more information on how to add or remove modules from the Quick Create menu or to change the order of the modules in the menu, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools#Configure_Navigation_Bar_Quick_Create">Developer Tools</a> documentation in the Administration guide. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/3523265d-77f5-21a7-268b-550286f0a4b8.png" alt="" width="211" height="321" /><br />Clicking on an item in the Quick Create menu will open the record view form for the specific module. When using quick create to make a record while viewing an existing record of another module where there is a relationship between the two modules, Sugar automatically creates a relationship between both records. For example : if you are viewing an account record (e.g. ABC Company) and create a new contact via the quick create form, the Account Name field in the contact record will automatically populate with "ABC Company", thus creating the link between the two records. All required fields will indicate "Required" in the field and must be completed prior to saving. Please note that administrator's have the ability to configure the record view layout via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on configuring record view layouts, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Layouts">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d63b4372-3751-61a7-d10d-5502869548bb.png" alt="" width="594" height="89" /></p>
<p>Once the necessary information is entered, click "Save". If you do not wish to create the record, simply click the Cancel button.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Because the Quick Create drawer overlays the page from where it is launched, using the browser's back button will appear to send you back two pages instead of to the previous view. To return to the previous view, use the Quick Create form's Cancel option instead.</p>

<h3 id="f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_Module_Search">Module Search</h3>
<p>Module search enables users to easily search by the record's name within the module and pull up matching records in the list view. The search also provides a Filter option allowing you to narrow your search further using the available options as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Create</strong> : Create a new custom filter which you can use to filter your search
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Note</strong>: You can also click "Create" to the right of the Filter option.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>All "Module Name"</strong> : Returns all records in the module (e.g. Accounts) to which you have access</li>
    <li><strong>My "Module Name"</strong> : Returns only records assigned to you</li>
    <li><strong>My Favorites</strong> : Returns only records you have marked as favorites</li>
    <li><strong>Recently Created </strong>: Returns only records you created in the module within the last 7 days</li>
    <li><strong>Recently Viewed </strong>: Returns only records you have viewed in the module within the last 7 days</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/ce2ec50f-32fe-232a-293d-550286007539.png" alt="" width="450" height="267" /></p>
<p>When you choose a filter, Sugar will return record's which match both the selected filter and any name provided in the open Search box in the filtered list view results. For example, if you select "My Accounts" in the Filter options and enter an account name, Sugar will only return account records with a matching name that are assigned to you. Once the search is complete, the relevant results will populate in the <a href="#f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_List_View">list view</a> below the search bar. To see all account records to which you have access, simply select the All Accounts option in the filter and remove any text from the search bar. You can also click the Clear icon within the selected filter option (e.g. My Accounts) in the Search bar to clear the filter and pull up all list view search results. When you run a search using a saved or created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. In addition, searches using the open Search box only or in combination with advanced filters (e.g. My Favorites) are preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/df508f45-07d1-ab5a-75c2-550286e1d652.png" alt="" width="293" height="161" /></p>
<p>Please note that you will only be able to see records as allowed by your team membership, user access type, and assigned roles. For more information on teams and roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/031_Team_Management">Team Management</a> and <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide.

<h4 id="f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_Creating_a_Filter">Creating a Filter</h4>
<p>Users can also create new filters via the Create option in the Filter list of the search bar. This allows users to add custom, complex filter options when searching in the module's list view. You have the option to add multiple fields to your new filter by clicking the Plus button to the right of the filter selection dropdown lists and set select operators along with their value(s). A filter's criteria need to be true for a record in order for it to appear in the list view search result. Additionally, filters with no specified values may be saved as a custom filter to act as a filter template when a user often searches using the same fields but with varying values. Please note that only fields you have view access for will appear in the Filter list when creating a search filter.</p>
<p>When you run a search using a created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter.</p>
<p>The following steps cover creating a new Assigned to filter for the Accounts module as an example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click the Filter option on the Accounts search bar then select "Create".
        <ul>

    <li>Select the field you wish to add to your filter, as well as the condition and matching criteria.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Note</strong>: Only fields you have view access for will be available to add in the Filter list.</li>
            <li>For Integer type fields (e.g. case number), you can select the "is any of" operator to pull up records that match any one of the set values (e.g. 100, 200, 300, etc.) in the search criteria.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>To add additional fields to the new filter, click the Plus button to the right of the filter.
        <ul>
            <li>To remove fields from the new filter, click the Minus button to the right of the filter.</li>
            <li>To clear any filter values (e.g. Will Westin), simply click the "x" to the right of the value or select "Reset" to the left of the Save button.</li>
        </ul><br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/1ee5cbce-9be8-eeee-cf85-550286c6e064.png" alt="" width="470" height="314" /></li>
</ol>
<p>The list view will automatically display results matching your filters as you create and modify the criteria.</p>
<h4 id="f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_Saving_a_Filter">Saving a Filter</h4>
<p>Saving a filter will preserve the chosen fields as well as the condition(s) of the matching value(s). Additionally, it will allow users to easily select previously created and saved filters from the Filter options.</p>
<p>The following steps cover saving a new search by Name filter for the Accounts module as an example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Create a <a href="#f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_Creating_a_Filter">new filter</a> to perform a search on your desired fields.</li>
    <li>Enter in a name for the new filter (e.g. "Accounts not assigned to Will"). <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/6fce5d16-e4e2-e06f-f478-5502868fa303.png" alt="" width="500" height="74" /></li>
    <li>Click "Save" to add this filter to the module's Filter options.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_Create_Button">Create Button</h3>

<h4 id="f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_Mass_Update">Mass Update</h4>
<p>Mass Updating allows users to make the same change to multiple records at one time from the module's list view. Users with administrator or developer level access can control which fields are available to change during mass update via Admin &gt; Studio. Currently, only fields with the data type of date, datetime, dropdown, multiselect, and radio may be altered during a mass update. For more information on configuring mass update, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Fields">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide. Sugar allows you to select up to 1000 records at a time for mass updates. If you desire to mass update more than 1000 records, you will need to perform the updates in several batches by creating a filter to partition the records into smaller subsets.</p>
<p>Please note that your ability to mass update may be restricted by a role. For more information on roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide.

<p>The following steps cover mass updating records from the Contacts list view as an example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to the Contacts list view by clicking the Contacts module tab.</li>
    <li>Use the list view's <a href="#f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_Module_Search">Module Search</a> to identify contacts you wish to modify.</li>
    <li>Select the desired contacts then choose "Mass Update" from the Actions menu.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d9c04d7c-42b8-b0b2-973e-550286968473.png" alt="" width="350" height="359" /></li>
    <li>The Mass Update panel will appear below the search bar. Set values for the field(s) you wish to alter.
        <ul>
            <li>To add additional fields for mass update, click the Plus icon to the right of the dropdown list.</li>
        </ul><strong>Note</strong>: For the Teams field, mark "Append Team(s)" to add the teams specified here to any existing team assignments. Not marking the checkbox will replace the existing team assignment with the new one. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d54e6713-1fea-026a-3240-55028647628a.png" alt="" width="518" height="137" /></li>
    <li>Click "Update" to save the changes to all of the currently selected contact records.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_Merging">Merging</h4>
<p>When duplicate records are identified in Sugar, you have the option to merge two or more records into a single record. Once the merge is complete, the duplicate record(s) will be deleted, and the primary record will remain. Please note that all relationships belonging to the duplicate records will be merged to the primary record meaning that any calls, meetings, cases, etc. related to the duplicate record(s) will automatically be related to the resulting, merged record.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Date Created, Date Modified, and Password field types are not supported when merging duplicate records in Sugar.</p>
<h5 id="f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_Merging_Via_List_View">Merging Via List View</h5>
<p><a href="#f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_Module_Search">Module Search</a> may be used to identify duplicate records by, for example, searching for records with similar names. Once your search has identified duplicate records, you can merge them directly from the list view.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to merge records via the list view:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Use the list view's <a href="#f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_Module_Search">Module Search</a> to identify duplicate records.</li>
    <li>Possible duplicates will be displayed in the list view. Select the duplicate record(s) that you wish to merge.
        <ul>
            <li>Please note that up to five records may be merged at once in Sugar. An error message ("Invalid number of records passed. The valid range is from 2 to 5 records.") will appear if more than five records are selected when attempting to perform a merge.</li>
        </ul><br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b8630db2-64f4-af7c-7cde-550286c9798e.png" alt="" width="580" height="238" /></li>
    <li>Select "Merge" from the Actions menu to display the Merging Records page. The primary record's field values are displayed on the left while other record's values are in columns to the right. For convenience, fields with differing values will appear on the top of the list. Saving the merge will preserve only the field values marked with the radio button into a single record.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b9f9ebbb-876f-4008-ad3a-5502864e6dd5.png" alt="" width="658" height="338" />
        <p>If 3 or more records are selected to be merged, an X icon will appear at the top right of each record. Clicking the "X" will remove the record from the merge process but will not delete the record.</p>
    </li>
    <li>To change which record is considered the primary, drag and drop the Primary label on the top of a different column.</li>
    <li>Review the field values in each column and click the radio button to the left of the value that should appear on the final record. You can also manually type or select a new value for any field as necessary.
        <ul>
            <li>Fields you do not have Edit access for cannot be edited on the merging records page.</li>
            <li><strong>Note</strong>: The Merging Records page aggregates the Teams field all in one place and displays it under the designated primary record's column. You can choose which team(s) the merged record should be assigned to by marking the checkbox next to the team name.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Preview what the final, merged record will contain as you work by clicking the eye icon to display the preview in the Intelligence Pane.</li>
    <li>Click "Save" once all fields you wish to appear on the single, merged record have their radio buttons selected.</li>
    <li>A pop-up message will display confirming that the duplicate record(s) should be deleted. Click "Confirm" to proceed.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_Add_To_Target_List">Add To Target List</h4>
<p>A target list consists of a group of individuals or organizations you wish to be included or excluded on a mass marketing campaign. These targets are typically identified based on a set of predetermined criteria such as being a prospect or existing customer, age group, industry, etc. Please note that only the Accounts, Contacts, Leads, Targets, and Users records may be added to the target list.</p>
<p>There are various ways to add records to a target list in Sugar including using the Add to Target List option from the module list view's Actions menu. For more information on target lists and other methods of adding records, please refer to the <a href="#d9cb2f7b-b601-60f7-5f90-556f637df06d_Target_Lists">Target Lists</a> documentation. Sugar allows you to select up to 1000 records at a time when adding to a target list. If you desire to add more than 1000 records to a target list, you will need to perform the additions in several batches.</p>
<p>The following steps cover adding account records to a target list via the Accounts list view as an example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to the Accounts list view by clicking the Accounts module tab.</li>
    <li>Use the <a href="#f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_Module_Search">Module Search</a> to find the Account records you wish to add to a target list.</li>
    <li>Select the desired account records then choose "Add to Target List" from the Mass Actions menu. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/2cdf1ef7-d166-9f56-b84e-5502866bbf49.png" alt="" width="335" height="379" /></li>
    <li>Below the Accounts search bar, locate and select the desired target list in the dropdown list or click "Create Target List" to add to a new target list. Click "Update" to add the record(s) to the new or existing target list. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/959355fa-00ed-c938-a956-550286b215e9.png" alt="" width="534" height="119" /></li>
</ol>
<p>In order to view the accounts that have been added, you can navigate to the Target Lists module. Click the target list's name to enter the record view, and you will see the account records within the Accounts subpanel. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/618b60cc-a14b-9de3-c0dc-550286649799.png" alt="" width="676" height="146" /></p>
<h4 id="f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_Delete">Delete</h4>
<p>Users have the ability to delete record's that are invalid or should no longer appear in their organization's Sugar instance via the module's list view. Deleting via the list view allows for mass deleting multiple records at once as well as single record deletions. Please note that deleting records will not delete the related records and will only remove the relationship, so you may wish to also delete any related records to avoid orphaned records.</p>
<p>Please note that your ability to delete records in Sugar may be restricted by a role. For more information on roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide. Check with your system administrator if you do not see the Delete options.</p>
<p>The following steps cover deleting account records from the Accounts list view as an example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to the Accounts list view by clicking the Accounts module tab.</li>
    <li>Use the <a href="#f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_Module_Search">Module Search</a> to find the Account records you wish to delete.</li>
    <li>Select the desired account records then choose "Delete" from the Actions menu.
        <ul>
            <li>You can also click the Record Actions menu to the far right of the record's row and select "Delete" to delete individual records from the list view.</li>
        </ul><br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/afbfc7f7-a9e4-7ab9-357a-5502869b5b78.png" alt="" width="342" height="388" /></li>
    <li>A pop-up message will display asking for confirmation. Click "Confirm" to proceed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sugar allows you to select up to 1000 records at a time for deletion. If you desire to delete more than 1000 records, you will need to perform the deletions in several batches.</p>
<h4 id="f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_Export">Export</h4>
<p>Sugar's Export option allows users to download all fields for the selected records to their computers as a .CSV (comma-separated values) file. This may be useful when needing to use data with other software such as Microsoft Excel or to update existing records by exporting, making changes, then importing the altered records back into Sugar. For more information on updating existing records via import, please refer to the <a href="#f-87f1-f338-50da-551b227d034a_Importing_Updates_to_Existing_Records">Import</a> documentation. Due to PHP memory limitations on the server, there may be occasions when the application times out while exporting a large number of records. If you encounter an error when performing this action, we recommend selecting the records in smaller batches. <br />Records may be exported from the list view by selecting "Export" from the Actions menu. Users with access to the Reports module also have the option of creating or accessing reports containing specifically chosen fields for records and their related record(s). Please note that only Rows and Columns-type reports have the ability to be exported. For more information on exporting records in Sugar, please refer to the <a href="#e6004c-15af-3450-3b7e-551b22bbe5d2_Export">Export</a> documentation. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/3a91d520-f1cd-fcd4-0c4e-550286ccf1dc.png" alt="" width="343" height="386" /></p>
<p>Please note that your ability to export from Sugar may be restricted by a role.

<h4 id="f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_Recalculate_Values">Recalculate Values</h4>
<p>This feature allows calculated values to be recalculated following the addition or alteration of a calculated field in Studio. For more information on calculated fields, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Using_Sugar_Logic">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide. Sugar allows you to select up to 1000 records at a time for recalculating values. If you desire to recalculate values for more than 1000 records, you will need to perform the recalculation in several batches.</p>
<p>Note: This action will not appear unless the user is an Admin or has developer-level access to the module and if there is at least one calculated value in that module. Please note that your ability to recalculate values may be restricted by a role. For more information on roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide.

<h3 id="f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_Favorite_Designation">Favorite Designation</h3>
<p>Users have the option to mark records as favorites via the module list view. This allows users to designate records that are important or will be viewed often so that they can easily be accessed via the search filter's My Favorites option or from the module tab's Favorites option. In the module's list view, the star on the left of each record's row is orange once marked to indicate a favorite record.</p>
<p>The following steps cover marking records as favorites via the Accounts list view as an example:</p>

    <li>Navigate to the Accounts list view by clicking the Accounts module tab.</li>
    <li>Use the <a href="#f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_Module_Search">Module Search</a> to find the Account records you wish to mark as favorites.</li>
    <li>Mark the star icon on the left of each desired account's row.</li>
    <li>To remove the account as a favorite, click the star again to revert it to gray. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/c47248ec-3b93-8605-a5b5-550286fc1b99.png" alt="" height="113" width="359" /></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_Following_Designation">Following Designation</h3>
<p>Users can also choose to follow specific records to which they have access to in Sugar by selecting "Follow" in the Record Actions menu on the list view. The ability to follow records allows each user to personalize their activity stream by specifying which records' posts should appear on the activity streams displayed on their Home page and module list view. Please note that you will automatically follow records that you create as well as records that are assigned to you. You will not, however, automatically follow records you import. Should a user lose access to a record in Sugar, they will automatically stop following that record.</p>

</ol>
<h3 id="f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_Column_Reordering">Column Reordering</h3>
<p>List view provides the ability to reorder columns by dragging and dropping the title of the column to the desired location. The new column order will remain for a user upon subsequent visits to the module until the user's browser cache is cleared. You can reset the column order back to the default view by clicking the Gear icon to the far right of the list view column headers and selecting "Reset default view". Please note that this option only appears if the current list view column order is different from the default column order. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/bde65059-6c44-f369-5cb4-55028606d6b5.png" alt="" width="696" height="187" /></p>
<h3 id="f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_Column_Resizing">Column Resizing</h3>
<p>Users can easily adjust the size of columns in module list views per their viewing preference. Simply place your cursor on the column divider, and when the Left and Right arrow appears, click and drag the column to the desired size. The set column width will be preserved when you navigate away from the page. Sugar will render the preferred column size across sessions until the user removes or resets the relevant browser cookies. You can reset the column width back to the default size by clicking the Gear icon to the far right of the list view column headers and selecting "Reset default widths". Please note that this option only appears if at least one of the column widths in the current list view is different from the default column width. Changes to the column width made by administrators in Studio are only respected if the user has not resized the specific column in the list view. The column width set by the user will supersede the default column width configured in Studio until the user resets the list view back to the default widths. For more information how admins can set column widths, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio/#Editing_List_View_Layout">Studio</a> documentation.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/74c63049-142c-7164-e48b-55028638c52e.png" alt="" width="696" height="215" /></p>

<h4 id="f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_Find_Duplicates">Find Duplicates</h4>
<p>Between multiple users working in Sugar, importing new records, and converting leads, it is possible for duplicate records to be accidentally input to the system. Before creating a new record, a good practice is to first check that the record does not already exist in Sugar. You can locate duplicate records for cleanup using <a href="#f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_Module_Search">module search</a> from the list view. Searching for records with similar names or other information can turn search into a powerful, duplicates-finding tool. Sugar also provides a wizard for finding potential duplicates that is available from the record view and may be used as shown below. If duplicate records are detected, you can perform a merge per the <a href="#f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_Merging">Merging</a> section of this documentation.</p>
<p>Please note that your ability to use the Find Duplicates action may be restricted by any role which prevents record deletion. For more information on roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide. Check with your system administrator if you do not see the Find Duplicates option.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to locate duplicate records using the Find Duplicates option from the record view:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to a record view.</li>
    <li>Choose "Find Duplicates" from the Actions menu. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/33a21e8b-f617-7abf-451b-550286076898.png" alt="" width="400" height="139" /></li>
    <li>Potential duplicate records will be listed on the Find Duplicates page. Select the duplicate record(s) you wish to merge then click "Merge Duplicates".
        <ul>
            <li>You can preview the duplicate record's details by clicking the Preview button to the far right of the records row.</li>
            <li>You can search for specific records from the list view if you wish to check for more possible duplicates. For more information on performing a search, please refer to the <a href="#f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_Module_Search">Module Search</a> section of this documentation.</li>
            <li>You can also click the Column Selection icon above the Preview button to change the list of fields that display on the list view column headers.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>Once you click "Merge Duplicates", the merging process with the current record will begin. For instructions on performing the merge that follows, please refer to Steps 3-8 of the <a href="#f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_Merging_Via_List_View">Merging Via List View</a> section of this documentation.</p>
<h4 id="f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_Copy">Copy</h4>
<p>Users can create new record's by duplicating an existing record from the record view. The copy option is useful if the record you are creating has similar information to an existing record. Please note that related records to the original record will not be copied to the newly created record. <br />The following steps cover creating a contact by duplicating an existing record as an example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to a contact's record view.</li>
    <li>Click the Actions menu and select "Copy". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/7a1a5145-cbfb-01d9-063f-550286210766.png" alt="" width="477" height="259" /></li>
    <li>The displayed record view is pre-populated with the original contact's values. Update the necessary fields, then click "Save". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/ca1d62c6-11d1-da83-e44f-550286ec61a4.png" alt="" width="469" height="164" /></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_Historical_Summary">Historical Summary</h4>
<p>Users can easily view quick details for the various related activities (e.g. calls, meetings, notes, emails, etc.) that have taken place via the Historical Summary option. Simply navigate to the module's (e.g. Accounts) record view and select "Historical Summary" from the Actions menu to view the historical activities related to the record in one place.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/aa972a60-d4e8-5495-0fe3-5502869f0e64.png" alt="" width="429" height="231" /></p>
<p>The Historical Summary page will display each activity's subject, type, status, date created, etc. and you can simply click the activity's name to view the full details for each activity. You can also preview the activity record via the intelligence pane by clicking the Preview icon to the far right of each record's row. It will provide users with key information regarding the record as well as the related activity stream information (if any). For more information on activity streams, please refer to the <a href="#c0dd8-1b9d-6cdc-d731-551b22c834a8_Activity_Streams">Activity Streams</a> documentation. Please note that preview is only available for modules (e.g. Task, Note) using the Sidecar user interface.</p>
<p>The historical summary list view provides the ability to reorder columns by dragging and dropping the title of the column to the desired location. The new column order will remain for a user upon subsequent visits to the module until the user's browser cache is cleared. You can reset the column order back to the default view by clicking the Gear icon to the far right of the list view column headers and selecting "Reset default view". Please note that this option only appears if the current list view column order is different from the system's default column order.</p>
<p>Users can also easily adjust the size of columns in the historical summary list view per their viewing preference. Simply place your cursor on the column divider, and when the Left and Right arrow appears, click and drag the column to the desired size. The set column width will be preserved when you navigate away from the page. Sugar will render the preferred column size across sessions until the user removes or resets the relevant browser cookies. You can reset the column width back to the default size by clicking the Gear icon to the far right of the list view column headers and selecting "Reset default widths". Please note that this option only appears if at least one of the column widths in the Historical Summary list view is different from the default column width.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/4b3badc0-59f7-6368-33fb-550286c7d511.png" alt="" width="846" height="248" /></p>
<h4 id="f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_View_Change_Log">View Change Log</h4>
<p>Changes made to each record are tracked over time, and for most modules users are able to view the history of changes via the change log in each record view. To view the change log, navigate to a module's record view and select "View Change Log" from the Actions menu. Please note that only fields marked as "Audit" in Admin &gt; Studio will be displayed in the change log. For more information on designating a field for audit, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Fields">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b28d9f89-29fa-d321-7188-550286a8c3a8.png" alt="" width="450" height="252" /></p>

<p>Users have the ability to delete record's that are invalid or should no longer appear in their organization's Sugar instance via the module's record view. Deleting via the record view allows you to delete a single record in the module. Please note that deleting records will not delete the related records and will only remove the relationship, so you may wish to also delete any related records to avoid orphaned records.</p>
<p>Please note that your ability to delete records in Sugar may be restricted by a role. For more information on roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide.

<p>Users have the option to mark records as favorites via the module's record view. This allows users to designate records that are important or will be viewed often so that they can easily be accessed via the search filter or from the module tab. In the module's record view, the star to the right of the record's name is orange once favorited.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/3d33fc3f-0ab5-2dfd-8e4e-550286f8c42b.png" alt="" width="281" height="99" /></p>

<h3 id="f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0___Twitter_Connector"><span>Twitter Connector</span></h3>
<p>Sugar comes with built in connectors to external data sources to enable you to connect your Sugar data to common social media platforms (e.g. Twitter). These integration's can help to bring you closer to your customers and partners using social media. For more information on what connectors are available and how to enable and configure them, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/05_System#Connectors">Connectors</a> section in the System documentation of the Administration guide.</p>
<p>Users can view and access twitter feeds in Sugar as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Add and share twitter feeds via Sugar's <a href="#c0dd8-1b9d-6cdc-d731-551b22c834a8_Activity_Streams">Activity Streams</a></li>
    <li>View twitter feeds via the Twitter dashlet on Sugar's <a href="#c0efb-c46a-70e0-f792-551b22e7d6e8_Home">Home page</a> and <a href="#d03d1-d6ae-25ce-a8e4-551b225ee8d6_Intelligence_Pane">Intelligence Pane</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that administrators must first configure the Twitter connector before users can view twitter feeds via the Twitter dashlet. For more information on how to configure the Twitter connector, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/05_System#Connectors">Connectors</a> section in the System documentation. <br />The following steps cover adding the Twitter ID to view feeds via the Account record views intelligence pane as an example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to an account record view's intelligence pane and verify that the Twitter dashlet is there.
        <ul>
            <li>If the Twitter dashlet is not displayed in the intelligence pane, you can add the dashlet by editing the dashboard. For more information on adding dashlets, please refer to <a href="#d03d1-d6ae-25ce-a8e4-551b225ee8d6_Adding_Dashlets">Adding Dashlets</a> section of the Intelligence Pane documentation.</li>

    <li>View the record's details and locate the Twitter Account field. Click the Pencil icon to the left of the Twitter Account field and enter in a Twitter ID. Click "Save" to preserve the change.
        <ul>
            <li>If the Twitter Account field is not available on the record view, administrators must add the field via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on adding fields to layouts, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Editing_Layouts">Studio</a> documentation.</li>
        </ul><br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d26ba70e-0e59-e733-bdbf-5502866942ae.png" alt="" width="466" height="229" /></li>
</ol>
<p>Once the Twitter ID is saved on the record view, navigate to the Twitter dashlet in the intelligence pane to view the associated twitter feeds for the account.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b3b6b388-854a-27e9-b909-550286fb0ed7.png" alt="" width="675" height="229" /></p>
<p>Please note that if the Twitter ID is not entered in the Twitter Account field, then the Twitter connector will try to pull feeds by finding a match based on the record's name (account name, contact name, etc.). Also, if there is a custom field <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/05_System#Mapping_Connector_Fields">mapped</a> to Twitter, the Twitter Account field will still be verified first to see if there is a valid Twitter ID and the Twitter dashlet will pull feeds using this account. If the Twitter Account field is blank, then it will check the custom field that is mapped and pull feeds based on the Twitter ID entered. If both fields are blank, then it will check the record's name to try and find a matching account to pull twitter feeds. For more information on mapping connector fields, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/05_System#Mapping_Connector_Fields">System</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<p>Twitter dashlets on the Home page and module's list view need to have a valid Twitter ID associated in order to display the feeds. Simply click the Gear icon on the upper right of the dashlet, select "Edit", and enter the appropriate Twitter ID. Save the change and the corresponding twitter feeds will display in the dashlet.</p>
<h3 id="f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_DB_Connector">D&amp;B Connector</h3>
<p>The D&amp;B connector allows users to search, view, access, and import key information for companies via various D&amp;B dashlets in the Account record view's intelligence pane.

<h3 id="f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_Subpanels">Subpanels</h3>
<p>Beneath the module (e.g. Accounts) record's fields are subpanels containing related records from various modules (e.g. Contacts, Leads, Opportunities, etc.). You can create a related record as well as link an existing record directly from the subpanel. Once the records appear within the subpanel, users can preview the record's detail and edit the record's data directly from the record view. Please note that the subpanels are viewable when you access the Data View section of the module's record view.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/ca8201b4-c8bf-195b-a821-55028651001d.png" alt="" width="468" height="224" /></p>
<h4 id="f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_Filter_Options">Filter Options</h4>
<p>While in Data View, all of the module record's related records will be displayed beneath the record's fields. Users have the ability to search for records which appear in the subpanels as well as filter the view to only display a specific module (e.g. Leads, Contacts, etc.). To locate a record by name, enter the keyword into the Search bar, and the subpanel(s) with the matching record(s) will appear below. To filter, simply click the Related option to the far left of the Search bar and select the module whose subpanel you wish to view. Filter and search may be combined to only display matching records within a selected module. To see all subpanels to which you have access, simply select "All" in the Related options and remove any text from the search bar. When you run a search using a saved or created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the page. In addition, searches using the open Search box only or in combination with advanced filters (e.g. My Favorites) are preserved when you navigate away from the page.<br /><br />When a Sidecar module (e.g. Contacts, Leads, Tasks, etc.) is selected from the Related options, you have the option to filter the related subpanels further using one of the available options (e.g. My Favorites, Recently Created, etc.). Please note that you can also create custom filters for related Sidecar modules. Once the related module (e.g. Contacts) is selected, either click the Filter option and select "Create" or click "Create" to the right of the Filter option. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e9acde1a-cd08-12e7-b21b-5502862dbafa.png" alt="" height="220" width="449" /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/9c1b9606-2144-39fd-f19e-550286f71732.png" alt="" width="588" height="209" /></p>
<h4 id="f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_Reordering_Subpanels">Reordering Subpanels</h4>
<p>Users can easily move subpanels to a new location on the record view by dragging and dropping the subpanel's header. The new subpanel order will remain for a user upon subsequent visits to the module until the user's browser cache is cleared.</p>
<p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/cbafe0dc-a1d3-06ed-571e-550304afa317.png" alt="" width="668" height="322" /></p>
<h4 id="f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_Related_Record_Subpanels">Related Record Subpanels</h4>
<p>The most common type of subpanels displayed on a module's record view contain the related records belonging to various modules. The relationship type determines whether a related record will be displayed in the field listing or in a subpanel. For example, an account may be related to multiple contacts which means that the related contacts will be displayed in a subpanel beneath the fields.</p>
<p>Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to change the fields (e.g. Name, Assigned User, etc.) and labels of each subpanel by configuring the layout via Admin &gt; Studio to provide visibility to the most important fields. For more information on modifying subpanels, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio/#Editing_Subpanels">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

<p>TinyMCE is a third-party WYSIWYG tool that allows users to provide HTML formatting in specific sections in Sugar without requiring any HTML knowledge. TinyMCE is available when sending email, creating email templates, creating knowledge base articles, as well as other places within Sugar. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/7ff51371-44ee-e48e-0565-550286316e0a.png" alt="" width="670" height="82" /></p>
<p>The following are some descriptions of the more commonly used features in TinyMCE:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Text Formatting</strong> : Use the folllowing buttons to format text to be bold, italics, underlined, or stricken through. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/832ce929-e959-046b-5820-5502866f51fd.png" alt="" width="246" height="86" /></li>
    <li><strong>Alignment</strong> : Use the following buttons to change the alignment of the text to be left, center, right, or justified. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b90fa006-42fc-43a3-e8f7-550286f22a25.png" alt="" width="246" height="86" /></li>
    <li><strong>Fonts</strong> : Use the following dropdowns to select special section formatting, fonts, and sizes. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e276be48-33c2-0506-c917-550286e5bae4.png" alt="" width="424" height="79" /></li>
    <li><strong>Layout Formatting</strong> : Use the following buttons to utilize bullet list, ordered lists, and tables. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/96a44d85-9794-cb4b-a37c-55028653b2fc.png" alt="" width="247" height="84" /></li>
    <li><strong>Links and Images</strong> : Use the following buttons to create a link, remove a current link, or add an image. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/3269cbb1-11ad-3fbb-1b4c-550286b74f85.png" alt="" width="444" height="84" /></li>
    <li><strong>Advanced HTML</strong> : Click the HTML button to view your content in full HTML code. You may add and change the HTML to furthur refine your content. <br /><br />Not all HTML is allowed to be saved in Sugar. The following are some examples of HTML that will be removed when saved:
        <ul>
            <li>Anything outside of the &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt; tags.</li>
            <li>Any &lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt; tags.</li>
            <li>Any &lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt; tags.</li>
            <li>Any &lt;form&gt;&lt;/form&gt; tags.</li>
            <li>Any &lt;input&gt; tags.</li>
        </ul><strong>Note</strong>: Inline CSS can be added to some elements (e.g. &lt;p&gt;, &lt;pre&gt;, and &lt;span&gt;), but due to different email client's rendering HTML email in unexpected ways, inline CSS is not allowed on some elements (e.g. &lt;div&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, and &lt;table&gt;).<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/6b0e19e9-1910-0271-2c45-550286ad92c9.png" alt="" width="256" height="89" /></li>

<h2 id="aa0024-444d-8f4c-44b6-551b2222828c_Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The user interface in Sugar is essentially everything you see and can interact within Sugar. Knowing what buttons allow you to do what actions and how to quickly add and edit information is critical to managing your customer information. This documentation is divided into related sections in order to cover in detail, interface options to perform specific tasks.</p>
<h2 id="aa0024-444d-8f4c-44b6-551b2222828c_Legacy_Modules">Legacy Modules</h2>
<p>This documentation will cover the Legacy user interface which is carried over from Sugar 6. Below is a list of modules which use the Legacy user interface. Other modules use the updated Sidecar user interface which is described in detail in the <a href="#f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_User_Interface">User Interface</a> documentation.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Calendar</li>
    <li>Campaigns</li>
    <li>Contracts</li>
    <li>Documents</li>
    <li>Emails</li>
    <li>Knowledge Base</li>
    <li>Quotes</li>
    <li>Reports</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Custom modules that are created in Module Builder will utilize the Sidecar user interface. Custom modules installed to an instance prior to Sugar 7 that were not created in Module Builder will use the Legacy user interface upon upgrade to 7.x.</p>
<h2 id="aa0024-444d-8f4c-44b6-551b2222828c_List_View">List View</h2>
<p>Each module in Sugar contains a list view to search and display records in a table format. To access a module's list view, simply click the module tab (e.g. Calls) in the navigation bar at the top of Sugar. <br />The list view displays all records meeting the current search criteria and to which your user has access. By default, Sugar sorts records in descending order of their creation date. You can view the basic details of each record within the field columns or select the record name to view it in the detail view. <br /><br />Please note that you will only be able to see records as allowed by your team membership, user access type, and assigned roles. For more information on teams and roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/031_Team_Management">Team Management</a> and <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/1be725fd-5c05-d19d-415f-5503041b9394.png" alt="" width="473" height="194" /></p>
<p>You have the option to change what fields are displayed in each module's list view by configuring your layout options in the Advanced Search. For more information on configuring your list view, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Layout_Options">Layout Options</a> section of the Search documentation. Users with administrator or developer access also have the ability to change what fields are visible in the list view via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on editing layouts, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Layouts">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<h3 id="aa0024-444d-8f4c-44b6-551b2222828c_Basic_Search">Basic Search</h3>
<p>The basic search is at the top of the list view for each module and offers a few, commonly used fields for a simplified search experience. From the Basic Search panel, you can click "Advanced Search" to access additional search functionality as needed. <br />The following buttons and checkboxes are common across many Legacy modules' Basic Search panel and have the following functions:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Search</strong> : Click the Search button or press your Return/Enter key to perform the search.</li>
    <li><strong>Clear</strong> : Click the Clear button to clear all criteria from the searchable fields.</li>
    <li><strong>My Items</strong> : Select this box to return only records assigned to you.</li>
    <li><strong>My Favorites</strong> : Select this box to return only records you have marked as favorites.</li>
    <li><strong>Open Items</strong> : Select this box to return only records with an open status (e.g. Planned).</li>
</ul>
<p><br />When you run a search, Sugar will return records matching all (as opposed to any) of the fields and checkboxes for which you have given a value. For example, if you select "My Items" and enter a name or subject, Sugar will only return records with a matching name or subject that are assigned to you. Once the search is complete, the relevant results will populate in the list view below the search panel. To see all records to which you have access within the module, simply click "Clear" and then "Search" to perform a blank search with no filters. Please note that you will only be able to see records as allowed by your team membership, user access type, and assigned roles. For more information on teams and roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/031_Team_Management">Team Management</a> and <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide. <br />Administrators can configure what fields appear on the Basic Search for each module via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on editing layouts, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Layouts">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.<img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/200561f8-fc0b-76ed-71e1-55030464265b.png" alt="" width="672" height="79" /></p>
<h3 id="aa0024-444d-8f4c-44b6-551b2222828c_Advanced_Search">Advanced Search</h3>
<p>Advanced Search offers a more in-depth search experience than Basic Search including additional fields, layout options, and saved search capability. From the Advanced Search panel, you can click "Basic Search" for simplified searching.</p>
<p>The following buttons, checkboxes, and dropdowns are common across many Legacy modules' Advanced Search and have the following functions:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Search</strong> : Click the Search button or press your Return/Enter key to perform the search.</li>
    <li><strong>Clear</strong> : Click the Clear button to clear all criteria from the searchable fields.</li>
    <li><strong>My Favorites</strong> : Select this box to return only records you have marked as favorites.</li>
    <li><strong>Layout Options</strong> : Use the expandable Layout Options section to configure your list view. For more information, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Layout_Options">Layout Options</a> section of the Search documentation.</li>
    <li><strong>Saved Searches</strong> : Save, recall, update, and delete searches which you use often. For more information, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Saved_Search">Saved Search</a> section of the Search documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you run a search, Sugar will return records matching all (as opposed to any) of the fields for which you have given a value. For example, if you select "My Favorites" and enter in a field to search, Sugar will only return records matching that field that you have marked as favorites. When searching by a multiselect or dropdown field (i.e. "Assigned to"), however, Sugar will return records matching any of these selections. Once the search completes, the relevant results will populate in the list view below the search panel. To see all records to which you have access within the module, simply click "Clear" and then "Search" to perform a blank search with no filters. Please note that you will only be able to see records as allowed by your team membership, user access type, and assigned roles. For more information on teams and roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/031_Team_Management">Team Management</a> and <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide. <br />Administrators can configure what fields appear on the Advanced Search for each module via Admin &gt; Studio.

<h3 id="aa0024-444d-8f4c-44b6-551b2222828c_Selecting_Records">Selecting Records</h3>
<p>The list view in Sugar allows you to select a single record to view by clicking on the name or subject of the record to open it in the detail view. You can also select multiple records at once and perform certain actions on those records.</p>
<p>To select or deselect records in the Legacy modules list view, use the following methods:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Individual Selection</strong> : Mark the checkbox on the left of each record's row on the list view you wish to select. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/770ddb70-7792-d14a-ede8-550304b0118f.png" alt="" height="235" width="629" /></li>
    <li><strong>Checkbox Selection</strong> : To select or deselect multiple records on the list view, use the options in this checkbox dropdown menu.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Select This Page</strong> : Selects all records shown on the current page of list view results. You can also click the open checkbox to the left of the Checkbox Selection menu to select all records on the current page.</li>
            <li><strong>Select All</strong> : Selects all records in the current search results across all pages of list view results.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong><strong>Note</strong></strong>: When using "Select All" you can not un-select single records, but will have to use the Deselect All option.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Deselect All</strong> : Deselects all records that are currently selected.</li>
        </ul><br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e0521498-1252-1a27-f173-5503049f92c8.png" alt="" height="220" width="588" /></li>
</ul>
<p>When selecting records, you can page through all of the records and Sugar will remember which records are selected. Depending on your Sugar settings you may see the count of records being selected or you may see a plus sign (+) to refer to more records. Simply select the Deselect All option to remove all selected records regardless of how they were initially selected.</p>
<h3 id="aa0024-444d-8f4c-44b6-551b2222828c_Mass_Actions_Menu">Mass Actions Menu</h3>
<p>The Actions menu to the right of the checkbox dropdown allows you to perform various actions on the currently selected records. It allows you to perform actions such as Delete, Mass Update, and Export for one or more records. Please note that not all Legacy modules have these actions available. The sections below will cover the most common actions across the modules. For more information on actions available within a specific module, please refer to the list view section in the application guide pertaining to the specific module. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/4b6c2be4-fd67-406d-92f1-55028bf20052.png" alt="" height="99" width="228" /></p>
<h4 id="aa0024-444d-8f4c-44b6-551b2222828c_Delete">Delete</h4>
<p>The list view in Sugar allows you to easily mass delete records. Please note that deleted records are not permanently removed from the database, but are marked as deleted in the system so that it no longer appears in Sugar. These records can be recovered by anyone with direct database access. Also, deleting records in Sugar will not delete the related records and will only remove the relationship, so you may wish to also delete any related records to avoid orphaned records. <br />The following steps cover deleting call records via the Calls list view as an example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to the Calls list view by clicking the Calls module tab.</li>
    <li>Use the <a href="#aa0024-444d-8f4c-44b6-551b2222828c_Basic_Search">Basic</a> or <a href="#aa0024-444d-8f4c-44b6-551b2222828c_Advanced_Search">Advanced Search</a> to find the Call records you wish to delete.</li>
    <li>Select the desired call records individually or using the <a href="#aa0024-444d-8f4c-44b6-551b2222828c_Selecting_Records">checkbox dropdown's</a> options.</li>
    <li>Choose "Delete" from the Actions menu.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/81ae70d7-9b17-be90-6348-55028bcf6793.png" alt="" height="169" width="273" /></li>
    <li>A pop-up message will display asking for confirmation. Click "Ok" to proceed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Due to PHP memory limitations on the server, there may be occasions when the application times out while deleting a large number of records. If you encounter an error when performing this action, we recommend selecting the records in smaller batches.</p>
<h4 id="aa0024-444d-8f4c-44b6-551b2222828c_Mass_Update">Mass Update</h4>
<p>Mass Updating allows users to make the same change to multiple records at one time from the list view. Users with administrator or developer level access can control which fields are available during mass updates via Admin &gt; Studio. Currently, only fields with the data type of date, datetime, dropdown, multiselect, and radio may be altered during a mass update. For more information on configuring mass update, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Fields">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide. Due to the PHP memory limitations on the server, there may be occasions when the application times out while mass updating a large number of records. If you encounter an error when performing this action, we recommend selecting the records in smaller batches. <br />Please note that your ability to mass update may be restricted by a role. For more information on roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide. Check with your system administrator if you do not see the Mass Update option. <br />Use the following steps to mass update records from the list view:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to the list view by clicking the module tab in the navigation bar.</li>
    <li>Use the list view's <a href="#aa0024-444d-8f4c-44b6-551b2222828c_Basic_Search">Basic</a> or <a href="#aa0024-444d-8f4c-44b6-551b2222828c_Advanced_Search">Advanced Search</a> to identify records you wish to modify.</li>
    <li>Select the desired records individually or using the <a href="#aa0024-444d-8f4c-44b6-551b2222828c_Selecting_Records">checkbox dropdown's </a>options.</li>
    <li>Choose "Mass Update" from the Actions menu.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5ec56ce4-635f-8079-bf42-550304ad90b2.png" alt="" width="373" height="254" /></li>
    <li>Scroll to the Mass Update panel and set values for the fields you wish to alter.<br /><strong>Note</strong>: For the Teams field, use "Replace" to remove existing team assignments before adding those specified here. Use "Add" to add the teams specified here to any existing team assignments.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/c13d6402-f208-eaee-a7b1-5503043ad076.png" alt="" width="693" height="196" /></li>
    <li>Click "Update" to save the changes to all of the currently selected records.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="aa0024-444d-8f4c-44b6-551b2222828c_Favorite_Designation">Favorite Designation</h3>
<p>Each Sugar user has the option to designate their own favorite records within modules which are important or will be viewed often so that they can easily be accessed via search or from the module tab. Once records are marked as favorites, use the My Favorites checkbox in the <a href="#aa0024-444d-8f4c-44b6-551b2222828c_Basic_Search">Basic</a> or <a href="#aa0024-444d-8f4c-44b6-551b2222828c_Advanced_Search">Advanced Search</a> to retrieve your favorites or select from your most recent favorites directly from the module tab. <br />Use the following steps to mark records as favorites via the list view:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to the list view by clicking the module tab in the navigation bar.</li>

<h3 id="aa0024-444d-8f4c-44b6-551b2222828c_Field_Panels">Field Panels</h3>
<p>Field panels are what hold the fields for a record in the detail view. Most modules come with two panels defined by default: Overview and Other. Please note that the field panels can be collapsed to hide unnecessary data. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/9fbb34a0-d313-eeca-bd85-55030430aa5d.png" alt="" width="569" height="299" /></p>
<p>Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to change the fields (e.g. Name, Assigned User, etc.) and labels inside the field panels as well as move, create, and edit existing field panels via Admin &gt; Studio to provide visibility to the most important fields. Field panels can also be collapsed by default via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on modifying field panels, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Layouts">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<h3 id="aa0024-444d-8f4c-44b6-551b2222828c_Subpanels">Subpanels</h3>
<p>Beneath the module record's fields are subpanels containing related records from various modules (e.g. Activities, Documents, Contacts, etc.). The subpanels that appear in a record's detail view is based on the relationships defined for the current module as well as the administrative settings on which subpanels are set to display in Sugar. You can expand and collapse subpanels as well as rearrange them per your viewing preference. For more information on changing the display of subpanels, please refer to the <a href="#aa0024-444d-8f4c-44b6-551b2222828c_Layout">Layout</a> section of this documentation. You can create related records as well as relate an existing record directly from the subpanel. Please note that the actions available in the Actions menu can vary between certain subpanels (e.g. Activities, History).</p>
<p>Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to change the fields (e.g. Status, Subject, etc.) and labels of each subpanel by configuring the layout via Admin &gt; Studio to provide visibility to the most important fields. For more information on modifying subpanels, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Subpanels">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<h4 id="aa0024-444d-8f4c-44b6-551b2222828c_Activities_and_History">Activities and History</h4>
<div>
    <p>The Activities and History subpanels are special subpanels in Sugar that show data from multiple modules based on certain criteria. For example, a meeting with a status of "Planned" will appear in the Activities subpanel. Once the meeting is changed to a status of "Held", it will move from the Activities subpanel to the History subpanel. All related note and email records will appear in the History subpanel as there are no filters on those modules, but notes and emails will never display in the Activities subpanel. If you customize the status field for any of the modules, the records that hold a custom status will appear in the Activities subpanel. But code level customizations would be required to have a new status show in the History subpanels. <br />Please refer to this chart for the criteria both subpanels use to query data:</p>

    <p>Since the Activities and History subpanels contain records from many different modules, there are some differences in the actions and record display than in normal subpanels. Each record in both subpanels will have an icon to the far left indicating which module the record originates from. For example, if the record is a call then the Telephone icon will display to the left of the subject. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/7b97d2da-b2cf-3ba5-d3be-55028d7dd35c.png" alt="" width="320" height="418" /></p>
    <p>Normal subpanels typically have a Create and Select option to create or link related records. The Activities and History subpanels have multiple actions due to the fact that there are multiple modules involved. <br />You have the following actions available from the Activities subpanel:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Create Task</strong> : Creates a new task record related to the record currently being viewed.</li>
        <li><strong>Schedule Meeting</strong> : Creates a new meeting record related to the record currently being viewed.</li>

<h2 id="c0dd8-1b9d-6cdc-d731-551b22c834a8_Previewing_Posts">Previewing Posts</h2>
<p>User's can preview activity stream posts by clicking the Preview button to the far right of the post. The intelligence pane will display the record's details with key information regarding the record as well as any related activity stream information. Please note that preview is available for Create, Update, Link, and Unlink-type posts in the activity stream. To close the preview, simply click the "X" on the upper right of the intelligence pane.</p>
<p>Also, messages posted via the Home page or List View activity stream cannot be previewed as records are not automatically referenced within the post. The Preview button will be grayed out and display a message ("Preview disabled: No data available") when you hover on the button. Messages posted via the record view can be previewed on the Home page and List View activity stream since the record is automatically referenced within the post. For linked and unlinked type posts, only the primary record that is linked or unlinked to can be previewed via the intelligence pane. For example, the below post states that Tony Baley is now linked to Avery Software Co. Since Avery Software Co is the primary record that the contact is now linked to, Avery Software Co will display when previewing the post.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/f175d00f-e32a-2cce-9fa8-55030442aa55.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/f175d00f-e32a-2cce-9fa8-55030442aa55.png" width="666" height="224" /></p>
<p>Please note that records for modules using the Legacy user interface cannot be previewed if included in the post (e.g. Link-type post) and will generate an error message ("Legacy modules cannot be previewed") when you hover on the button. For more information on the Legacy user interface, please refer to the <a href="#aa0024-444d-8f4c-44b6-551b2222828c_User_Interface_Legacy_Modules">User Interface (Legacy Modules)</a> documentation.</p>
<p>Also when you are viewing a record in record view, you cannot preview a post that references the same record. For example, if you are viewing Avery Software Co's record view and there is an update post referencing Avery Software Co in the record view's activity stream, you will not be able to preview any posts where Avery Software Co is the primary record. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/ae95ac22-e495-226a-16da-5503040de797.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/ae95ac22-e495-226a-16da-5503040de797.png" width="485" height="417" /></p>

        <h4 id="d03d1-d6ae-25ce-a8e4-551b225ee8d6_List_View_Dashlet">List View Dashlet</h4>
        <p>The List View dashlet enables users to view a list of records for a specific module (e.g. Accounts, Contacts, Leads, etc.) in Sugar. When configuring the dashlet, simply select the primary module (e.g. Accounts, Contacts, Leads, etc.) you wish to view a list of records for along with the filters (e.g. columns, display rows, etc.) you wish to apply. Please note that the dashlet title (e.g. My Accounts, My Contacts, etc.) will vary based on the primary module selected when adding the dashlet. Certain modules (Accounts, Contacts, Leads, etc.) in Sugar display the List View dashlet by default in their list view's intelligence pane. For example, if you navigate to the Contacts list view, the My Accounts dashlet will appear in the intelligence pane dashboard.</p>
        <p>Once added, you can <a href="#d03d1-d6ae-25ce-a8e4-551b225ee8d6_Configuration_Options">configure</a> the dashlet as necessary by clicking the Gear icon on the upper right if you wish to change the designated module for the dashlet, apply pre-defined or custom filters, etc. Please note that any changes made by the administrator to the List View layout in Studio affects the list of available fields in the module's list view dashlet layout.

        <p>When added to an Intelligence Pane, the My Activity Stream dashlet will display stream items in context to the data within the main container of the page. For example, if you add the dashlet to a dashboard on the main Accounts module page, the main container of the page contains the Accounts list view. Therefore, the My Activity Stream dashlet will restrict activity stream items to only those activities related to the Accounts module. Similarly, if the dashlet is added to the Opportunity module's Intelligence Pane, the My Activity Stream dashlet will restrict activity stream items to only those activities related to the Opportunities module. If the My Activity Stream dashlet is added to any record view's Intelligence Pane dashboard, the dashlet will restrict activity stream items to only those activities related to the record displayed in the main container on the page.</p>
        <p>To filter the My Activity Stream dashlet, <a href="#d03d1-d6ae-25ce-a8e4-551b225ee8d6_Configuration_Options">edit</a> the dashlet and click once on the Filter button.

        <h5 id="d03d1-d6ae-25ce-a8e4-551b225ee8d6_DB_Account_Create_Dashboard">D&amp;B Account Create Dashboard</h5>
        <p>When a new account is created in Sugar, the D&amp;B Account Create dashboard appears in the intelligence pane to the right of the record view. The dashlets (D&amp;B: Company Search, D&amp;B: Search Results, etc.) in this dashboard change as it progresses from searching for the company, to viewing the results, and importing the company details. As you enter in the name of the account in the Name field, a search will be performed within the D&amp;B: Company Search dashlet to pull up any matching companies in the D&amp;B database. You can use the wildcard character (% or *) at the beginning or end of your text when entering in the account name to broaden the search if you wish. Please note that the search results are based on matching company names as well as the trade style names associated to the company in the D&amp;B database. So even though some of the companies on the results list do not seem like a match, it will be included if an associated trade style name matches the search term. Please note that the first ten matching companies will display in the D&amp;B Account Create dashlet, and you can click "Show More D&amp;B Search Results" at the bottom of the dashlet to display the other companies. The company's headquarters, subsidiary companies, and branches will be identified accordingly within the dashlet. Please note that any companies detected as a duplicate of an existing Sugar account, will be marked as "Duplicate" in red to the right of the company's name in the search result. The duplicate check is based on the DUNS number, which is a unique company ID populated in the account's record view when data is imported from D&amp;B. In addition, if an existing account does not have a DUNS number but has a matching name, a duplicate check is performed in Sugar upon saving the new account to pull up any matching accounts.</p>
        <p>Select the appropriate company in the search results list and the company's key information (e.g. name, phone, address, etc.) will display in the D&amp;B: Company Information dashlet. To return back to the previous search results, simply click "Back To D&amp;B Search Results" at the bottom of the D&amp;B: Company Information dashlet.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/ad84b5f3-f011-4ea2-f8bb-55030425ba61.png" alt="" width="692" height="329" /></p>
        <p>Each line of company information in the dashlet is marked automatically for import into Sugar. Simply click the Import button on the upper right of the dashlet to import the data into the new account record. Please note that if the company is detected as a duplicate of an existing Sugar account, the duplicate record(s) will appear within the record view and you can click "Ignore Duplicate and Save" if you wish to proceed with creating the record. Please note that you can preview the duplicate record(s) as well as edit the record as you wish before saving.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/14d70b29-120d-3e02-b34a-55030475d5fd.png" alt="" width="627" height="343" /></p>
        <p>If you do not wish to import certain company data, be sure to un-check the specific line of company information before proceeding with the import. Once the import is completed successfully the data will appear in the corresponding Sugar fields in the record view to the left of the intelligence pane. Please note that the DUNS number associated to the company in D&amp;B will be populated automatically in the DUNS field of the Accounts record view. The DUNS number is a unique identifier in D&amp;B and is used to pull associated information (e.g. contacts, competitors, etc.) specific to the company from the D&amp;B database.</p>
        <h5 id="d03d1-d6ae-25ce-a8e4-551b225ee8d6_DB_Import_and_Enrich_Dashlet">D&amp;B: Import and Enrich Dashlet</h5>
        <p>The D&amp;B: Import and Enrich dashlet can be added to the Account record view's intelligence pane and allows you to search for companies within the D&amp;B database based on the company's name or location (Country and State/Province/Region). Please note that you can use the wildcard character (*) when entering in the account name to broaden the search if you wish. For example, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text such as "*energy" to pull up any companies that have the word "energy" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends. All three D&amp;B license types (Basic, Standard, Premium ) include the D&amp;B: Import and Enrich dashlet. This dashlet can be used to search, view, and import key company information (e.g. address, phone, etc.). To perform a search by company name only, simply click the link below the Match button. Once the search is performed, the list of matching companies will display, and you can click "Show More D&amp;B Search Results" at the bottom of the dashlet to load the next set of results. Please note that you can define the number of results that display in the dashlet per load by clicking the Gear icon on the upper right, selecting "Edit", then changing the Page Size value. The "Back to Import &amp; Enrich" link will also display at the bottom of the dashlet and you can click this link if you wish to perform a different search.</p>
        <p>You can perform a search based on location by selecting the country and state on the D&amp;B: Import and Enrich dashlet and clicking "Match". Please note that performing a search based on location will display confidence levels (Low Confidence, Medium Confidence, High Confidence) to the right of each company's name in the results list. The confidence level indicates how close of a match the company in the results list is based on the company's name, city, zip code stored in the database compared to the company name entered and location (country and state) you selected on the search form. The list of matching companies will display, and you can click "Show More D&amp;B Search Results" at the bottom of the dashlet to load the next set of results. The "Back to Import &amp; Enrich" link will also display at the bottom of the dashlet and you can click this link if you wish to perform a different search. Click the specific company from the results list to view the company's information. To return back to the previous search results, simply click "Back to D&amp;B search results" at the bottom of the dashlet. When the information is imported into Sugar, the DUNS field in the Accounts record view is populated as well with a nine-digit numeric value from D&amp;B. The DUNS number is unique to each company in D&amp;B and is used to identify and pull relevant data specific to the company via the D&amp;B database.</p>
        <p>For accounts that already have the DUNS number, the D&amp;B: Import and Enrich dashlet will perform a refresh check each time you open the account's record view to see if there is any updated company information in the D&amp;B database. If the information in the account's record view is up to date based on the information D&amp;B has, then the dashlet will display "Up to Date" on the upper right of the dashlet. Fields that are up to date will be marked as "Duplicate" in yellow to the right of the dashlet row. If the data pulled from D&amp;B is newer than what is in Sugar, there will be a Date Stamp in green to the right of the field in the dashlet. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b69fd002-80a3-9ea2-efaf-550304f908f1.png" alt="" width="408" height="178" /></p>
        <h5 id="d03d1-d6ae-25ce-a8e4-551b225ee8d6_DB_Company_Information_Dashlet">D&amp;B: Company Information Dashlet</h5>
        <p>The D&amp;B: Company Information dashlet displays additional information pertaining to the company such as organization start year, line of business, etc. The DUNS number in the account's record view is necessary to pull the company information from D&amp;B. Please note that the level of information provided depends on the type of license agreement (Basic, Standard, Premium) your organization has with D&amp;B. You can expand the dashlet by clicking the Show More link on the bottom left of the dashlet to view more information. The information in this dashlet cannot be imported into Sugar as it is a read-only dashet.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/340d0f3f-bdd4-0887-cae7-550303a27dc6.png" alt="" width="402" height="274" /></p>
        <p>Please note that if multiple industry codes are displayed in the dashlet, the company's primary code will be marked as "Primary" in green to the right of the dashlet row. You can also click the Gear icon on the upper right then select "Edit" to configure the type of information (e.g. Organization Details, Location, etc.) you want displayed in the dashlet across all accounts. Simply click the specific category (e.g. Organization Name) available for the dashlet to open up and view the associated data elements (e.g. Name, Trade Name). You can choose to hide any of the data elements you do not wish to view in the D&amp;B: Company Information dashlet by un-checking the specific item(s) in the configuration options page. Marking the checkbox again will display the information in the dashlet. Click "Save" to preserve the changes made to the dashlet. Please note that the data elements available to view in the D&amp;B: Company Information dashlet varies between the D&amp;B license types. Also, there may be instances where a particular data element (e.g. Organization Identification Number) does not exist in D&amp;B for some companies, so it will not display in the dashlet regardless of whether the specific data element is marked to display. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b8cf05da-ffc7-77d1-2f4a-550304cb0b26.png" alt="" width="560" height="525" /></p>
        <h5 id="d03d1-d6ae-25ce-a8e4-551b225ee8d6_DB_Contact_Information_Dashlet">D&amp;B: Contact Information Dashlet</h5>
        <p>The D&amp;B: Contact Information dashlet is available for all three D&amp;B license types (Basic, Standard, Premium) and displays contacts related to the specific company pulled from the D&amp;B database. Please note that the account must have a DUNS number in order for the associated contacts to pull from D&amp;B. The dashlet will display a search form as well as a list of related contacts once the DUNS number is recognized for the account. Contacts in the dashlet that display "Premium" to the right of the name indicates that an email address and/or phone number exists for the contact in D&amp;B. Please note that only the Premium D&amp;B license type provide email address and phone number information for contacts.</p>
        <p>Click "Show More D&amp;B Search Results" at the bottom of the dashlet to load the next set of results. Please note that you can define the number of results that display in the dashlet per load by clicking the Gear icon on the upper right, selecting "Edit", then changing the Page Size value. You can select a contact from the list of results or perform a search using the contacts name (first or last or both) or job title. As you enter in the keyword, the results will start displaying similar names (e.g. entering Richard will include Rick in the results) matching the keyword. Please note that if you enter in a value for both the Name and Job Title field, both criteria's must be true for a record in order for it to appear in the dashlet search result. To clear the filter(s) and pull up all search results, simply click the Clear button to the right of the Search button.</p>
        <p>The dashlet will display the contact's profile information (e.g. name, job title, etc.) along with their job and compensation history (if available). For premium contacts, the full email address and phone number will not display properly (e.g. AGxxxx@example.com) in the dashlet, but will render the full information on the record view when importing the contact to Sugar. Please note that premium contact information is only available for the Premium license type. To import the contact, simply click "Import" on the upper right of the dashlet to create the record in Sugar<span>.</span> The newly created contact record will have the D&amp;B Principal ID field populated automatically in the record view upon import. The D&amp;B Principal ID is used to identify the contact and detect duplicate records, so any record(s) in the dashlet detected as a duplicate of an existing record in Sugar will display "Duplicate" to the right of the contact's name.

                    <p>The Filters section of the Configuration Options page allow you to filter your dashlet based on pre-defined filters (e.g. My Favorites, Recently Created, etc.) as well as create custom filters. For example, if you select "My Contacts" in the Filter options, the List View dashlet will only display contact records that are assigned to you. To see all records to which you have access, simply select the All option in the filter.</p>
                    <p>The following Filter options are available to filter the List View dashlet:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Create</strong> : Create a new custom filter which you can use to filter the List View dashlet</li>
                        <li><strong>All "Module"</strong> : Select this filter to display all records in the module to which you have access</li>

                    <p>Users can also create new filters via the Create option in the Filter list. This allows users to add custom, complex filter options when filtering the List View dashlet.

<h2 id="b0656-33f7-a639-1149-551b2296a4eb_Tabbing_in_Sugar">Tabbing in Sugar</h2>
<p>Using the Tab key (Alt+Tab for Safari browser) on your keyboard enables you to easily navigate through Sugar's navigation bar which spans across the top of the screen. Please note that the default tab order is from left-to-right. As you hit the Tab key, each option (e.g. home, module tabs, global search, notifications, etc.) on the navigation bar will be highlighted in blue, and you can press "Enter" if you wish to access the module's list view, actions menu, notification's page, etc. For example, if you press "Enter" on the triangle in the Accounts module tab, the corresponding actions menu will open and you can use your Up and Down arrow on your keyboard to select an option (e.g. Create Account, View Accounts, etc.). If you hit "Tab" again while the list view actions menu is open, you will navigate to the next option (e.g. Contacts) on the navigation bar and the current actions menu will close.</p>
<p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/eda4fbac-f966-4e66-d05d-550304209b24.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/eda4fbac-f966-4e66-d05d-550304209b24.png" width="800" height="258" /></p>
<p>In addition, you can continue to tab outside of the navigation bar to highlight and access certain elements (e.g. Create button, Search box, Intelligence Pane, etc.) of the home page, list view, record view, etc. For example, if you continue tabbing after you get to the end of the navigation bar while viewing the Accounts list view, the tab will move onto the various elements on the page highlighting buttons, actions menu, account names, etc. You can simply hit "Enter" if you wish to perform a specific action (e.g. create a record, open the actions menu, etc.) on the list view. The tab will go through all of the currently displayed records on the list view then move onto the intelligence pane and footer before going back to the navigation bar again. Please note that each link (e.g. Mobile, Shortcuts, Tour, etc.) in Sugar's footer will be highlighted as you tab from left-to-right. Simply hit "Enter" on your keyboard if you wish to access any of the links on the footer. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/2ec3518d-69c7-34a2-b4a0-550304ff8fcb.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/2ec3518d-69c7-34a2-b4a0-550304ff8fcb.png" width="430" height="61" /></p>

<h1 id="b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Search">Search</h1>
<h2 id="b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Sugar comes with the ability to search across the entire system to easily locate and filter records in the system. Users can perform a search via the module's list view, record view, as well as global search. The module search allows you to locate records easily and effectively in a module-specific manner. Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the module list view or subpanel view of the record. Global search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. This documentation will go over the basics of the various search options and cover how to perform a search, filter a search, view results, etc.</p>
<h2 id="b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Global_Search">Global Search</h2>
<p>Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. For more information regarding searching within a single module, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/03_Search/index.html#List_View_Search_(Sidecar_Modules)">List View Search</a> and <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/03_Search/index.html#Record_View_Search_(Sidecar_Modules)">Record View Search</a> section in this documentation. The Global Search bar is typically located on the top right hand side of each Sugar screen. Full Text Search is used with Global Search to search throughout nearly all fields and modules for an enhanced search experience. To use global search, you need to first enter the keyword into the search box and the pop-up results will begin appearing once you enter in at least one character. Clicking the magnifying glass icon or hitting your Return/Enter key will cause Sugar to return exact matches for your keyword rather than matches with words beginning with your keyword.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8baa2712-d50f-cfd6-ee59-55030410accc.png" alt="" height="43" width="323" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>Please note that not all fields in Sugar are enabled by default for search, but can be enabled by an administrator. For more information on how to enable and disable fields and modules in Global Search, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Fields">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration Guide.</p>
<p>Also, Global Search may or may not be case-sensitive depending on your database configuration. In general, Global Search on Sugar installations running on MySQL and MSSQL databases are not case-sensitive. But global search on a Sugar installation running on Oracle is case-sensitive by default. If your system is hosted on SugarCRM's On-Demand platform then your system is not case-sensitive by default. This allows searches performed for "rob" using a lowercase "r" to locate contact records in the system with a name of "Rob" with an uppercase "R".</p>
<p>Use the following steps to search for a contact name using Global Search:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click into the Global Search box on the upper right of Sugar and type in your search (e.g. jane).</li>
    <li>Sugar will begin searching the system once you enter in at least four characters into the search box.
        <ul>
            <li>Please note that up to five results will be displayed along with the field that met your search criteria for each result.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Click the record's name in the results dropdown list to access the record's details.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d333473b-e8ae-cc87-d52c-550304cb6d3a.png" alt="" height="137" width="228" /></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Search_Operators">Search Operators</h3>
<p>Special search operator characters may be used to broaden or refine search results in Sugar. Use wildcard characters for a more flexible search or to fine tune results with the restrictive operators. Search operators can be combined for queries, but if quotation marks and wildcard characters are used together, the quotation marks will supersede the wildcard, resulting in a search for an exact match.</p>
<p>The following operators can be used in Global Search:</p>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Operator</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>% or *</td>
            <td>Use either of these wildcards to represent any number of characters, including zero.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>?</td>
            <td>Use this wildcard to represent a single character.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>""</td>
            <td>Restrict search results to exact matches of the entire word or group of words within the double quotes. Using quotes in combination with a wildcard will negate the wildcard resulting in an exact match search.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>-</td>
            <td>Do not include search results that contain the phrase that follows the minus sign.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>Please note that a wildcard is implied at the end of all search queries. For example, searching for "Acme" will match account names like Acme Industries or Acme Funds. Insert a wildcard before your search query with a % sign (%Acme) to match account names that begin with or contain the query, such as "ABC Acme Industries". If performing a multiple word search, the wildcard is only appended to the last word, not all words. If you click the search button or hit Enter/Return, the wildcard will no longer be appended and Sugar will only search for an exact match of your search criteria.</p>
<p>The following are examples of Global Search queries using search operators:</p>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1">

<h3 id="b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_AND_vs_OR">AND vs OR</h3>
<p>Global Search uses the "or" operator by default when multiple keywords are entered in the search box. For example, if you enter in "jane smith" into the search box, Sugar will look for records that match "jane" or "smith". In the example below, "Tod Wren" appears on the results list as the related Account name has "Smith" in it, and John Smith appears because his last name matches "smith". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5a3731a1-0220-0fcc-7ac9-550304e153fc.png" alt="" height="216" width="232" /><br />Another advantage Full Text Search has is the ability to overwrite the default "or" operator with an "and" operator. To use an "and" operator, simply add an all caps "AND" between the two words you are searching. Using the example above, you can perform an exact search to only return results for records that match both "jane" and "smith". Please note that the "AND" must be capitalized or Sugar will consider it a keyword to search on and the "OR" operator will be applied still. <br /><strong><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/1ffdc821-1bff-8763-c0a3-5503049fc573.png" alt="" height="133" width="231" /></strong></p>
<h3 id="b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_View_All_Results">View All Results</h3>
<p>Click the View all results link at the bottom of the results window to see all results from your search. Here you will be able to see the modules and their respective counts on the left side of the page under the Filter by list as well as the search results. You can select the modules you wish to filter the search page by marking the specific modules you wish to view under the Filter by list. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/6ac45235-0944-2fb3-cc73-550304acb3b4.png" alt="" width="530" height="364" /></p>
<h3 id="b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Filtering_by_Module">Filtering by Module</h3>
<p>Global Search gives you the option to filter the search results by module. Click the triangle within the global search box then select the module(s) you wish to include in the search. By default, the Search all option is selected to include all modules when searching. To return search results for certain modules, mark the checkbox corresponding to the module(s) in the filter list. For example, if you select "Contacts" and enter in a contact name (e.g. joe) to search, Sugar will only return contact records with a matching name. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/2e6a2e90-7125-53aa-2b42-55030407e8f2.png" alt="" height="380" width="256" /><br />Alternatively you can add a special command to your search criteria to filter the results to a specific module. For example, if you wish to search all fields in the Contacts module that contain the word "jane", you can enter the following as your search criteria: Contacts._all:jane.</p>
<p>This tells Full Text Search to search the Contacts module and all fields containing the word "jane". This can be done with any module that has Full Text Search enabled, including custom modules.</p>
<p>For more information on how to filter by module and field name, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Filtering_by_Field">Filtering by Field</a> section below.<img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/2565c38b-5de0-3609-28e4-550304bcf7b4.png" alt="" height="134" width="230" /></p>
<h3 id="b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Filtering_by_Field">Filtering by Field</h3>
<p>Users have the option to filter their search by a specific field name or a field name in a specific module by entering in a special command. For more information on filtering by module, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Filtering_by_Module">Filtering by Module</a> section of this documentation.</p>
<p>For example, if you wish to search for records in any module containing the word "smith", enter the keyword into the search box. Sugar will return records containing the word "smith" in the account name, contact name, email address, and any other field that is enabled for searching. For more information on how to enable fields for search, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Field_Options">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/80583827-cbbb-1a16-c207-550304190da7.png" alt="" height="217" width="229" /><br />You can search by a specific field and value by entering in the field name (e.g. name, first_name, etc.) and the value into the search box. For example, you can enter "first_name:jane" if you wish to only search for records where the First Name field contains the word "jane".</p>

<p>In addition, you can further filter the search by specifying a module to the criteria so that the search is only performed within a specific module. For example, you can enter "Contacts.first_name:jane" if you wish to only search for records where the First Name field contains the word "jane" in the Contacts module.</p>
<p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a18c461b-c691-1014-7b70-550304b6c80f.png" alt="" height="131" width="228" /><br />Please note that the search criteria must have the correct module name, field name, and be case sensitive. Using a lowercase "c" for Contacts will return no search results as it does not match the module name in the system. The field name must also be entered as it exists in Sugar, so please ask an Administrator to confirm the correct field names via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on accessing fields in Studio, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Fields">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<h3 id="b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Admin_Configuration">Admin Configuration</h3>
<p>Sugar administrators have the ability to globally enable and disable modules for Global Search. Please note that disabled modules will not be included in search results nor in the list of modules to filter. For more information on how to enable and disable modules for Global Search, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/05_System#Enabling_Modules_for_Global_Search">Search</a> section of the System documentation in the Administration guide. <br />Administrators also have the ability to enable and disable specific fields for Global Search, as well as set the priority of the field in the search. To give a field a greater weight when searching, you need to adjust that field's boost level (e.g. low boost, medium boost, etc.). When a search is performed, matching records containing fields with a greater weight will appear higher on the search results list. For more information on how to add or remove fields from Global Search or to change their boost level, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Fields">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If changes are made to your instance's full text configuration, users on SugarCRM Mobile must log out and back in for the corresponding fields to be displayed as expected.</p>
<p>Global Search functions off of an index created from the data in your system. When creating and updating records, data is added and modified in the index accordingly. Occasionally the index can become corrupt or inefficient, which may require a system index to be performed. You can either perform a system index manually via Admin &gt; Search or schedule it by creating a scheduler for the full text search index system job in Admin &gt; Schedulers. For more information on how to run a system index on Full Text Search, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/05_System#Indexing_Full_Text_Search">System</a> documentation in the Administration guide.For more information on automating a system re-index, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/05_System/41_Schedulers#Creating_Schedulers">Schedulers</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<h3 id="b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Advanced_Options">Advanced Options</h3>
<p>The Advanced Options panel is available on the view all results screen of Global Search to allow users to enable and disable modules for the Filter by list specific to their login. Please note that administrators have the ability to globally enable and disable modules for global search via Admin &gt; Search. If the administrator globally disables a module, you will not be able to perform a search on that module or filter by that module when searching. The module will also no longer appear within the Advanced Options panel. For more information on how to globally enable and disable modules, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/05_System#Enabling_Modules_for_Global_Search">System</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<p>The following steps cover disabling the Leads module from the View all results page of Global Search as an example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Perform a search via Global Search then click "View all results" at the bottom of the pop-up results list. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/189e6255-cd9d-6f6b-2651-550304bff65b.png" alt="" width="227" height="296" /></li>
    <li>Click the Advanced link beneath the search box on the upper left to display the modules filter. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5bdb0eb8-4990-bd24-0f83-550304c9d84a.png" alt="" width="439" height="205" /></li>
    <li>Drag and drop the Leads module from the Enabled Modules column to the Disabled Modules column then click "Save" to preserve the change.
        <ul>
            <li>You can enable the module for search again by simply dragging and dropping the module from the Disabled Modules column to the Enabled Modules column.</li>
        </ul><br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/67b05e0c-69c9-387d-4a56-5503041c4388.png" alt="" width="452" height="319" /></li>
</ol>
<p>The Filter by list on the View all results page will no longer include the Leads module. Please note that module's in the Disabled Modules column are disabled only for the currently logged in user and will affect any future global searches until the module is re-enabled in the Advanced Options panel.</p>
<p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/20b810f1-bd18-f59c-0c95-550304ba7038.png" alt="" width="370" height="364" /></p>
<h2 id="b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_List_View_Search_Sidecar_Modules">List View Search (Sidecar Modules)</h2>
<p>List view search enables users to easily and effectively search by a record name in a module-specific manner to return relevant results they wish to view. The matching records will populate in the list view below the Search bar. Please note that the system retrieves all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. Sugar also automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %services). This will return any record that has the word "services" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends. For more information on how to use wildcards in module searches, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/03_Search/index.html#Wildcards_2">Wildcards</a> section of this documentation. To clear the search, simply click the "x" to the right of the search keyword and all records to which you have access will display on the list view.</p>
<p>In addition, the search provides a Filter option allowing you to narrow your search further using the available options on the list. For more information on the available filter options, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_5217bd5c-c557-5a36-778a-55b99f67e21e_Filter">Filter</a> section of this documentation. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/ce2ec50f-32fe-232a-293d-550286007539.png" alt="" height="273" width="460" /></p>
<p>When you choose a filter and run a search, Sugar will return records with a matching name from within the filtered list view results. For example, if you select "My Accounts" in the Filter list and enter an account name, Sugar will only return account records with a matching name that are assigned to you. You can also create new filters if you wish to add more complex filters for your search criteria. For more information on creating new filters, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Creating_a_Filter">Creating a Filter</a> section of this documentation.</p>
<p>To see all records to which you have access, simply select the All "Module Name" (e.g. All Accounts) option in the filter. Please note that you will only be able to see records as allowed by your team membership, user access type, and assigned roles. For more information on teams and roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/031_Team_Management">Team Management</a> and <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<h3 id="b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Wildcards">Wildcards</h3>
<p>Wildcards can be used to search for criteria without including the entire word in the search. Use a wildcard character in place of characters you do not require in your search. You may use any combination of wildcard characters in the Search box as you desire. Search operators can be combined for queries, but if quotation marks and wildcard characters are used together, the quotation marks will supersede the wildcard, resulting in a search for an exact match. The following wildcard characters can be used in the List View module search:</p>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Character</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Wildcard Use</strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>%</td>
            <td>Use this wildcard to represent any number of characters, including zero</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>_</td>
            <td>Use this wildcard to represent a single character</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>Please note that a wildcard is implied at the end of all search queries. For example, searching for "Acme" will match account names like Acme Industries or Acme Funds. Insert a wildcard before your search query with a % sign (%Acme) to match account names that begin with or contain the query, such as "ABC Acme Industries". If performing a multiple word search, the wildcard is only appended to the last word, not all words.</p>
<p>The following are example searches using wildcards in List View search:</p>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Search Criteria</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Matches</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Does Not Match</strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>rob</td>
            <td><strong>Rob</strong>, <strong>Rob</strong>ert, <strong>Rob</strong>in</td>
            <td>Bob, Jacob</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>%bert</td>
            <td>Al<strong>bert</strong>, <strong>Bert</strong>, Ro<strong>bert</strong></td>
            <td>Bart</td>
        </tr>

        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>When performing a search, Sugar will try to match your search text to the beginning of a record's field. Therefore, if an account name starts with an article like "A" or "The", this must be accounted for in the search by adding a wildcard (%) at the beginning of your text. For example, to properly return an account named "The ABC Company", you could enter "%abc" for Sugar to find a match in the system.</p>
<p>In addition, you can use the wildcard character when specifying the search criteria for custom filters with the "starts with" operator. Please note that the wildcard character will only work with the "starts with" operator. For example, if you wish to find all records containing the word "systems", then you can use the "starts with" operator and type "%systems" as the filter value. For more information on creating filters, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Creating_a_Filter">Creating a Filter</a> section of this documentation. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a6c2cf2c-d9f1-2d03-5c6d-5503043073a6.png" alt="" height="76" width="562" /></p>
<h3 id="b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_51e4496d-3cf0-ebaa-be9d-55b99f6addbe_AND_vs_OR">AND vs OR</h3>
<p>When searching in the List View search, Sugar uses the "and" operator. This means that if you are searching against multiple fields in your filter option, Sugar will place an "and" in between each search field returning only records matching all (as opposed to any) of your search criteria. For example, if you select "My Accounts" in the Filter options and enter an account name, Sugar will only return account records with a matching name that are assigned to you.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/541309a9-7b70-0a5d-2bbd-550304e808b5.png" alt="" width="631" height="109" /></p>
<p>The only time Sugar will use the "or" operator is when using a multi-select option in the search criteria. For example, you can create a custom filter for the Accounts list view search and select "Type", "is any of", then add "Customer", "Partner", and "Analyst". If you perform a search based on this new filter, the system will return account records that match any one of the values specified in the filter. For more information on creating custom filters, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Creating_a_Filter">Creating a Filter</a> section of this documentation.</p>

<p>Please note that if any additional fields (e.g. industry, status, etc.) are added to the custom filter, the operators between the Type field and the other fields will be an "and" operator.</p>
<h3 id="b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Filter">Filter</h3>
<p>Module search provides a Filter option which allows users to narrow their search further using the available options on the list.</p>
<p>The following options are available to users when filtering their List View search:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Create</strong> : Create a new custom filter which you can use to filter your search</li>
    <li><strong>All "Module Name"</strong> : Returns all records in the module to which you have access</li>
    <li><strong>My "Module Name" </strong>: Returns only records assigned to you</li>
    <li><strong>My Favorites</strong> : Returns only records you have marked as favorites</li>
    <li><strong>Recently Created</strong> : Returns only records you created in the module within the last 7 days</li>
    <li><strong>Recently Viewed </strong>: Returns only records you have viewed in the module within the last 7 days</li>
</ul>
<p>When you choose a filter and run a search, Sugar returns records with a matching name from within the filtered list view results. You can use one of the default filter options from the list or create a custom filter if you wish to have more complex filters options when searching.</p>
<h4 id="b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Creating_a_Filter">Creating a Filter</h4>
<p>Users can also create new filters via the Create option in the Filter list of the search bar. This allows users to add custom, complex filter options when searching in the module's list view. You have the option to add multiple fields to your new filter and set select operators (e.g. is any of, is, starts with, etc.) along with their value(s). A filter's criteria need to be true for a record in order for it to appear in the list view search result. Additionally, filters with no specified values may be saved as a custom filter to act as a filter template when a user often searches using the same fields but with varying values. Please note that only fields you have view access for will appear in the Filter list when creating a search filter.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Flex Relate-type fields are not available when creating search filters.</p>
<p>When you run a search using a created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away.</p>
<p>The following steps cover creating a filter for accounts with a type of "Customer", "Competitor", or "Partner", assigned to Sara Smith as an example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click the Filter option on the Accounts search bar then select "Create".
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Note</strong>: You can also click "Create" to the right of the Filter option.</li>
        </ul><br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/c59e82b4-a81c-3b56-b821-550304564e3a.png" alt="" height="208" width="331" /></li>
    <li>Select "Type" as the filter field and select the "is any of" operator then add "Customer", "Competitor", "Partner" as the search values. As you create the new filter criteria, it will be applied to the list view concurrently to display the matching results.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Note</strong>: The "is any of" operator allows the system to return records that match any one of the set values (customer, competitor, partner).</li>
            <li>To remove specific filter values (e.g. customer, partner, etc.), you can simply click the "x" to the right of the field or you can select "Reset" to the left of the Save button to clear all filter values.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>To add additional fields (e.g. Assigned to) to the new filter, click the Plus button to the right of the filter dropdown list.</li>
    <li>Select "Assigned to" as the secondary filter field and select the "is" operator then add "Sarah Smith".</li>
    <li>Enter in a name for the new filter (e.g. "Sarah's Accounts").</li>
    <li>
        <p>Click "Save" to add this filter to the module's Filter dropdown list. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/120b78dc-84ba-1eac-9ca3-550304fa1936.png" alt="" width="523" height="204" /></p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>The newly created filter will now appear as an option in the list view search's Filter list. Please note that you can easily delete custom filters by selecting the filter (e.g. Sarah's Accounts) from the Filter list, clicking the filter's name (e.g. Sarah's Accounts) on the Search bar, then clicking "Delete" on the filter details panel. You can also edit the custom filter as necessary via the filter details panel then click "Save" to preserve the changes made. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/50d6a07b-952f-0919-3636-550304a6d021.png" alt="" width="520" height="219" /></p>

            <td>_</td>
            <td>Use this wildcard to match a single character</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>Please note that a wildcard is implied at the end of all search queries. For example, searching for "Acme" will match account names like Acme Industries or Acme Funds. Insert a wildcard before your search query with a % sign (%Acme) to match account names that begin with or contain the query, such as "ABC Acme Industries". If performing a multiple word search, the wildcard is only appended to the last word and not all words.</p>
<p>The following are example searches using wildcards in related record search:</p>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1">

<p>When performing a search, Sugar will try to match your search text to the beginning of a record's field. Therefore, if an account name starts with an article like "A" or "The", this must be accounted for in the search by adding a wildcard (%) at the beginning of your text. For example, to properly return an account named "The ABC Company", you should enter "%abc" for Sugar to find a match in the system.</p>
<p>In addition, you can use the wildcard character when specifying the search criteria for custom filters with the "starts with" operator. Please note that the wildcard character will only work with the "starts with" operator. For example, if you wish to find all related records containing the word "smith", then you can use the "starts with" operator and type "%smith" as the filter value. For more information on creating filters, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Creating_a_Filter">Creating a Filter</a> section of this documentation. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/1dd66838-b5d9-648f-97da-55030457f4f2.png" alt="" height="75" width="563" /></p>
<h4 id="b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_5217bd5c-c557-5a36-778a-55b99f67e21e_Filter">Filter</h4>
<p>Record view search provides a Filter option which allows users to narrow their search further using the available options on the list.</p>
<p>The following options are available to users when filtering their Record View search:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Create</strong> : Create a new custom filter which you can use to filter your search.</li>
    <li><strong>All "Module Name"</strong> : Returns all records in the module to which you have access</li>
    <li><strong>My "Module Name" </strong>: Returns only records assigned to you</li>
    <li><strong>My Favorites</strong> : Returns only records you have marked as favorites</li>
    <li><strong>Recently Created</strong> : Returns only records you created in the module within the last 7 days</li>
    <li><strong>Recently Viewed </strong>: Returns only records you have viewed in the module within the last 7 days</li>
</ul>
<p>While in the record view, users can search for records which appear in subpanels beneath the record's fields and filter the view to only display a specific subpanel (e.g. Contacts, Accounts, etc.). When you choose a filter and run a search, Sugar returns records matching the search criteria for the specified related module in the record view. You can use one of the default filter options from the list or create a custom filter if you wish to have more complex filter options when searching.</p>
<h5 id="b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Creating_a_Related_Records_Filter">Creating a Related Records Filter</h5>
<p>Users can also create new filters via the Create Filter option in the Filter list of the search bar. This allows users to add custom, complex filter options when searching in the module's record view. You have the option to add multiple fields to your new filter and set select operators (e.g. is any of, is, starts with, etc.) along with the value(s) it must contain. Please note that each one of the filter's criteria need to be true for a record in order for it to appear in the subpanel view's search result. Unlike creating a filter for the list view search, you must first select a module from the Related list then select the Create option as it is specific to that module.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Flex Relate-type fields are not available when creating search filters.</p>
<p>The following steps cover creating a filter for the related Contacts module located in the state of "CA" as an example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click the Related option on a module record view's (e.g. Accounts) search bar then select "Contacts". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/18b5188c-60bc-7d99-b107-55030417c8d4.png" alt="" width="325" height="174" /></li>
    <li>Click the Filter option on the Search bar then select "Create".
        <ul>
            <li>You can also click "Create" to the right of the Filter option.</li>
        </ul><br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/96dab0af-0f1e-44bc-baef-550304e8c2ae.png" alt="" height="96" width="430" /></li>
    <li>Select "State" as the filter field and select the "exactly matches" operator then enter "CA" as the search value. As you add in the filter criteria's, it will be applied to the subpanel view concurrently to display any matching results.
        <ul>
            <li>To clear any filter values (e.g. CA), simply select "Reset" to the left of the Save button.</li>
            <li>You can also remove filter values by clicking the "x" within the search value (if applicable).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>To add additional fields (e.g. Assigned to) to the new filter, click the Plus button to the right of the filter dropdown list.</li>
    <li>Enter in a name for the new filter (e.g. "Contacts in CA").</li>
    <li>Click "Save" to add this filter to the related module's Filter dropdown list. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/982d964e-436b-393c-8ae2-5503048f85a0.png" alt="" width="603" height="104" /></li>
</ol>
<p>The filter will now appear as an option in the Filter list when "Contacts" is selected as the related module. Please note that you can easily delete custom filters by selecting the filter from the Filter list of the related module (e.g. Contacts), clicking the filter's name (e.g. Contacts in CA) on the search bar, then clicking "Delete" on the filter details panel. You can also edit the custom filter as necessary via the filter details panel then click "Save" to preserve the changes. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/2bf6ceb6-20ff-2d17-7329-550304fd8827.png" alt="" height="155" width="570" /></p>
<h3 id="b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Activity_Stream_Search">Activity Stream Search</h3>
<p>The record view's activity stream displays all posts specific to the current record you are viewing. Please note that users can view all post's in the record view's activity stream even if they do not follow the record in Sugar. To access the record view's activity stream, navigate to the module's record view (e.g. ABC Company) then click the Activity Stream button below the module's fields. For more information on activity streams, please refer to the <a href="#c0dd8-1b9d-6cdc-d731-551b22c834a8_Activity_Streams">Activity Streams</a> documentation. You can filter the posts on the activity stream based on the activity type by selecting one of the available options on the Filter list. For more information on filtering the activity stream, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Activity_Type_Filter">Activity Type Filter</a> section of this documentation.</p>

<h4 id="b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Activity_Type_Filter">Activity Type Filter</h4>
<p>The record view activity stream can be filtered to only display certain messages (e.g. Messages for Create, Messages for Update, etc.) by clicking "Filter" above the post input box then selecting the desired message type. This enables users to filter the activity stream to only display specific activity type's they wish to view. To view all posts in the activity stream, simply select the All Activity Stream option in the Filter list. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/f3dc4bbb-3e01-74cd-c44a-5503046cec81.png" alt="" width="506" height="259" /></p>

<p>Once the subpanel view displays the search results, users can easily view the related record's details directly from the record view by clicking the Preview icon to the far right of the record's row. The record's detail will display in the intelligence pane to the right of the record view and provide users with key information regarding the record as well as the related activity stream information. For more information on viewing previews, please refer to the <a href="#d03d1-d6ae-25ce-a8e4-551b225ee8d6_Viewing_Previews">Viewing Previews</a> sectionof the Intelligence Pane documentation. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a8a04bb3-92c4-acea-2c9b-550304b66851.png" alt="" width="711" height="374" /></p>
<h2 id="b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_List_View_Search_Legacy_Modules">List View Search (Legacy Modules)</h2>
<p>Modules using the Legacy user interface in Sugar has a list view with basic and advanced search functionality to help you find records easily and effectively in a module specific manner. These module-specific searches differ from global search in that you search by specific fields in a specific module, instead of across your entire Sugar database.</p>
<p>Much like global search, module search has the ability to use wildcards and automatically appends a wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. For more information regarding using wildcards in module searches, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/03_Search/index.html#Wildcards_3">Wildcards</a> section in this documentation.</p>
<h3 id="b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Basic_Search">Basic Search</h3>
<p>Basic search offers a few, commonly used fields for a simplified search experience. From the Basic Search panel, you can click "Advanced Search" to access additional search functionality as needed. <br />The buttons and checkboxes available in Basic Search panel have the following functions:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Search</strong> : Click the Search button or press your Return/Enter key to perform the search.</li>
    <li><strong>Clear</strong> : Click the Clear button to clear all criteria from the searchable fields.</li>
    <li><strong>My Items</strong> : Select this box to return only records assigned to you.</li>
    <li><strong>My Favorites</strong> : Select this box to return only records you have marked as favorites.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you run a search, Sugar will return records matching all (as opposed to any) of the fields and checkboxes for which you have given a value. For example, if you select "My Items" and enter a record name, Sugar will only return records with a matching name that are assigned to you. Once the search is complete, the relevant results will populate in the list view below the search panel. To see all records to which you have access, simply click "Clear" and then "Search" to perform a blank search with no filters. Please note that you will only be able to see records as allowed by your team membership, user access type, and assigned roles. For more information on teams and roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/031_Team_Management">Team Management</a> and <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentations in the Administration guide.<img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/83d41601-f677-7513-4ffd-55028d6a1258.png" alt="" width="610" height="53" /></p>

<h3 id="b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Advanced_Search">Advanced Search</h3>
<p>Advanced Search offers a more in-depth search experience than Basic Search including additional fields, layout options, and saved search capability. The search fields are context-sensitive and will vary depending on the module you are searching. From the Advanced search panel, you can click "Basic Search" for simplified searching. <br />The buttons, checkboxes, and dropdowns available in Advanced Search have the following functions:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Search</strong> : Click the Search button or press your Return/Enter key to perform the search.</li>
    <li><strong>Clear</strong> : Click the Clear button to clear all criteria from the searchable fields.</li>

<p>Advanced search allows users to perform ranged searches on certain date or numeric fields. Ranged search fields include a dropdown to select the type of predefined search including the following options:<img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/1b760afc-faab-3215-4f2b-55028dd3bb51.png" alt="" width="730" height="279" /></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date Fields</strong> : Equals, Last 7 Days, Last Month, Is Between, etc. <br />Depending on the option selected, there will be zero (e.g. Last 7 Days, Next 7 Days, etc.), one (e.g. Equals, Not On, etc.), or two (e.g. Is Between) input boxes to search on. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/18828547-7a96-5396-dbe8-55028d6730b0.png" alt="" width="329" height="234" /></li>
    <li><strong>Numeric Fields</strong> : Equals, Greater Than, Less Than, Is Between, etc. <br />Depending on the option selected, there will be one (e.g. Equals, Ddoes Not Equal, etc.) or two (e.g. Is Between) input boxes to search on. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/563b4f65-57ed-96c9-e538-55028da647ee.png" alt="" width="268" height="129" /></li>

<p>Fields can be enabled or disabled to allow range searches via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on how to enable or disable range searches on a field, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Field_Options">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<p>When you run a search, Sugar will return records matching all (as opposed to any) of the fields for which you have given a value. For example, if you select "My Favorites" and enter in a record name to search, Sugar will only return records with a matching name that you have marked as favorites. When searching by a multiselect or dropdown field (e.g. "Assigned to"), however, Sugar will return records matching any of these selections. Once the search completes, the relevant results will populate in the list view below the search panel. To see all records to which you have access, simply click "Clear" and then "Search" to perform a blank search with no filters. Please note that you will only be able to see records as allowed by your team membership, user access type, and assigned roles.

<h4 id="b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Layout_Options">Layout Options</h4>
<p>Sugar gives users the ability to personalize the list view of each module through the advanced search layout options feature. Users can pick which fields are displayed in the list view, the order they are displayed in, and which column the records are ordered by. <br />Use the following steps to personalize the list view for a module using the layout options from the advanced module search:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click on the Layout Options link to expand the available options below. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5c836e8d-4e62-9a91-60b9-55028d037f96.png" alt="" width="612" height="199" /></li>
    <li>Select any column name in the Display Columns panel and click the right aligned arrow to remove the column from the list view. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d2200249-c38a-7eec-085c-55028d7d4698.png" alt="" width="329" height="149" /></li>
    <li>Alternatively, select any column name in the Hide Columns panel and click the left aligned arrow to add a column to the list view. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/9877de41-d867-5899-8eba-55028d60c7f8.png" alt="" width="329" height="149" /></li>
    <li>Select any column name in the Display Columns panel and click the up or down aligned arrow to move a column left or right respectively in the list view. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/1818b759-a53d-b12f-27ca-55028d1cfaae.png" alt="" width="329" height="149" /></li>
    <li>In the Order By column dropdown, select a field to order your results by. Only columns in the Display panel will be available to order by and some columns (e.g. Email Address) are not available for sorting.</li>
    <li>Select a direction you wish to order the fields by: Ascending : 1-10, A-Z; Descending : 10 -1, Z-A
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: Clicking on a column header in the list view will temporarily override the sort selected here. In order to order by the selection made here again, simply click the Search button.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/49730182-653b-8098-4807-55028da0e95b.png" alt="" width="378" height="114" /></p>
    </li>
    <li>Click Search to execute the search. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/7cae03e7-2f86-b049-a958-55028d740f98.png" alt="" width="450" height="45" /></li>
</ol>
<p>Not all columns in each module can be used in the layout options by default. If there is a column you desire to add to your list view or order by, please contact your Sugar administrator to enable the desired fields. For more information on how to add or remove fields as options in the layout options section, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Editing_Layouts">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The layout options configured here supersede the default list view settings configured in Studio for the specified module. <br />Sugar remembers the last search run when you return to each module including whether or not the Layout Options panel was exposed. After changing your layout options, click "Layout Options" again to hide the expanded panel and click Search. Running a search locks in place whatever options you currently have on the search screen. Now the next time you run a search, the new options will be remembered and the Layout Options will be hidden. Click the Clear and the Search buttons to revert back to the default layout options.</p>
<h4 id="b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Saved_Search">Saved Search</h4>
<p>Sugar gives users the ability to save any layout option changes and search criteria for easy access to perform the same search at a later time. A common example of this would be a manager saving a search where only his or her employees are the Assigned Users on the record. This way, the manager can review all of their team's records at the click of a button. You can save an unlimited number of search results and the Saved Searches dropdown displays the last saved search at the top of the list. <br /><strong>Note</strong>: Saved searches are user specific and can not be seen or shared by other users.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to save a personalized search from the advanced module search:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Enter in any number of search criteria you desire.</li>
    <li>Enter in a name to designate the search into the "Save search as" textbox and click save.
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: Any layout option changes made will also be saved with the saved search.<img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/2fde4b39-0dc0-edd4-4981-55028da7db3e.png" alt="" width="637" height="59" /></p>
    </li>
    <li>The search is saved and executed. You now have the ability to modify any search criteria or layout options. After any necessary modifications are made click the Update button next to "Modify current search".
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: The name of the search you will be updating shows below the Update button.<img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/cbeec27d-e194-c7c5-014e-55028d343e41.png" alt="" width="634" height="39" /></p>
    </li>
    <li>There is no way to modify the name of a saved search. Alternatively you can execute a saved search, enter a new name into the "Save search as" textbox and click save. This will create a new saved search with the same criteria as the original with the new name. You may then proceed to delete the old saved search.</li>
    <li>To execute a previously saved search, simply select the desired search from the "Saved Searches" dropdown. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/973bee07-d75d-e79c-8e8c-55028dab8069.png" alt="" width="494" height="95" /></li>
    <li>This immediately executes the saved search.</li>
    <li>If you wish to remove a saved search, simply click the Delete button after executing a previously saved search.
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: The name of the search you will be deleting shows below the Delete button.<img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/607a21a9-7647-a9fb-746d-55028d58dd18.png" alt="" width="513" height="46" /></p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_51ff9028-69c2-80ea-9a1e-55b99fac9144_AND_vs_OR">AND vs OR</h3>
<p>When searching in the Basic or Advanced module search, Sugar uses the "and" operator, not "or". This means that if you are searching against multiple fields, Sugar will place an "and" in between each search field returning only records matching all of your search criteria. For example: A search performed for a record name "sugar" and the "My Items" check box will only return records where the record name contains "sugar" and the assigned to field is the user currently logged in.</p>
<p>The only time Sugar will use the "or" operator is when using the mutiselect options in the search criteria. For example : A search performed in the Accounts module for the industry field will allow you to select multiple options to search by. Performing a search on the industry field with Apparel, Banking, and Chemicals selected will return any records where industry is "Apparel" or "Banking" or "Chemicals".</p>
<p>If any other field is added into the search criteria the operators between the industry field and any other field will remain an "and" operator.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/50c50910-f058-7fb1-09a8-55028d4a28d8.png" alt="" width="569" height="49" /></p>

<p>Wildcards can be used to search for criteria without including the entire word in the search. Use a wildcard character in place of characters you do not require in your search. Use may use any number of wildcard characters in any combination you desire. Search operators can be combined for queries, but if quotation marks and wildcard characters are used together, the quotation marks will supersede the wildcard, resulting in a search for an exact match. The following wildcard characters can be used in the related module filters in Sugar:</p>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Character</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Wildcard Use</strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>%</td>
            <td>Use this wildcard to match any number of characters, including zero</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>_</td>
            <td>Use this wildcard to match a single character</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>Please note that a wildcard is implied at the end of all search queries. For example, searching for "Acme" will match account names like Acme Industries or Acme Funds. Insert a wildcard before your search query with a % sign (%Acme) to match account names that begin with or contain the query, such as "ABC Acme Industries". If performing a multiple word search, the wildcard is only appended to the last word and not all words.</p>
<p>The following are example searches using wildcards in related record search:</p>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Search Criteria</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Matches</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Does Not Match</strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>rob</td>
            <td><strong>Rob</strong>, <strong>Rob</strong>ert, <strong>Rob</strong>in</td>
            <td>Bob, Jacob</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

            <td>Al<strong>bert</strong>, <strong>Bert</strong>, Ro<strong>bert</strong></td>
            <td>Bart</td>

<p>When performing a search, Sugar will try to match your search text to the beginning of a record's field. Therefore, if an account name starts with an article like "A" or "The", this must be accounted for in the search by adding a wildcard (%) at the beginning of your text. For example, to properly return an account named "The ABC Company", you should enter "%abc" for Sugar to find a match in the system.</p>
<h3 id="b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Search_Memory">Search Memory</h3>
<p>Sugar by default automatically saves your most recent search criteria when leaving the module then repopulates the search fields the next time you return. For example: Perform a search in the Accounts module for "sugar". Navigate away from the Accounts module and then return back to the Accounts module. The search for "sugar" will automatically be shown and the relevant results will be shown below in the list view.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> : This can be an unintended result if a user is unaware of this functionality. For example: A search may have an assigned user selected that is not currently visible in the scrolling selection box. When running a new search, best practice is to click the Clear button before entering your search criteria.</p>
<p>Module search memory can be set to one of the following options:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Remember last search</strong> : This is the default behavior in Sugar</li>
    <li><strong>Populate only</strong> : This will populate the search criteria, but will not execute the search. <br /><strong>Note</strong> : This is recommended for systems experiencing performance issues.</li>
    <li><strong>Do not remember last search</strong> : Search will be cleared and executed every time the search is loaded</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: These options are global settings and will affect all users. Please be sure to inform users of any behavior change before making modifications.</p>

        <p>There are two buttons on the upper right of the dashlet which allow you to toggle between viewing tasks assigned to you and tasks assigned to users on your team. You can click the one person button to quickly view task records for which you are the owner. To view task records assigned to all users on your team, simply click the group button to the right of the one person button.

        <p>The History dashlet allows users to view a history of record's related activities (e.g. calls, meetings, emails) that have already taken place. The activity types are broken up into three tabs (Meetings, Emails, Calls) and displays a number on each tab to indicate the relevant count of historical activity records. You can also filter (Last 7 Days, Last 30 Days, Last Quarter) the History dashlet to only display a specific subset of the activities meeting the set time frame. Clicking the Plus icon on the upper right of the dashlet displays the Archive Email option which allows users to manually enter emails for historical purposes and create implicit relationships to records. Simply enter in the required information (e.g. Date Sent, From, Subject, etc.) along with the email body in the Compose Email window then click "Archive" to save the email record. </p>
        <p>There are two buttons on the upper right of the dashlet which allow you to toggle between viewing the record's activities assigned to you and activities assigned to users on your team.

        <p>The Saved Reports Chart dashlet allows you to view pre-defined report charts as well as charts of your saved reports. There are 17 pre-defined report charts that are available to select in the Saved Reports Chart dashlet. These pre-defined charts allow you to view information such as leads by lead source, calls by team by user, opportunities by lead source, etc. You also have the option to add custom report charts as dashlets by selecting the saved report when configuring the dashlet to add to your Home page. For more information on how to view report charts via dashlets, please refer to the <a href="#d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Viewing_Via_Dashlets">Viewing Via Dashlets</a> section of the Reports documentation. Please note that all report types (Summation Report, Matrix Report, Summation with Details Report) except for Rows and Columns-type reports have the chart option available to view as dashlets .</p>
        <p>You can also add and view report charts via the Intelligence Pane dashboard. For more information on adding, viewing, and configuring the Saved Reports Chart dashlet, please refer to the <a href="#d03d1-d6ae-25ce-a8e4-551b225ee8d6_Saved_Reports_Chart_Dashlet">Saved Reports Chart Dashlet</a> section of the Intelligence Pane documentation.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/176d5e88-9049-0408-6fad-5503066b50e5.png" alt="" width="499" height="229" /></p>
        <h4 id="c0efb-c46a-70e0-f792-551b22e7d6e8_My_Activity_Stream_Dashlet">My Activity Stream Dashlet</h4>
        <p>The My Activity Stream dashlet displays the user's main Activity Stream within a dashboard, eliminating the need to navigate to the Activity Streams view to monitor the most recent stream activities. As with other dashlets, you can display the most recent 5, 10, 15, or 20 stream items and specify an auto-refresh interval if desired. In addition, the standard Activity Stream filters can be enabled by editing the dashlet. For more information on configuring the dashlet, please refer to the <a href="#d03d1-d6ae-25ce-a8e4-551b225ee8d6_Editing_Dashlets">Editing Dashlets</a> section of the Intelligence Pane documentation.</p>
        <p>Like other Activity Stream views, the dashlet supports inline commenting on specific stream activities, but it does not allow record previews. For more information on Activity Streams, please refer to the <a href="#c0dd8-1b9d-6cdc-d731-551b22c834a8_Activity_Streams">Activity Streams</a> documentation. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b49b8171-af20-b872-a75b-550306c88db7.png" alt="" width="529" height="239" /></p>

        <h4 id="c0efb-c46a-70e0-f792-551b22e7d6e8_Forecast_Pipeline_Chart">Forecast Pipeline Chart </h4>
        <p>The Forecast Pipeline Chart dashlet illustrates the flow of open sales opportunities through the various sales stages by displaying the total dollar amounts for open records grouped by sales stage. The top of the sales funnel is the widest point and represents sales deals that are still in the earliest stage of "Qualification". The funnel narrows as unqualified prospects fall away and opportunities with higher win potential approach final sale.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/eb1b25c4-5baa-3751-dff6-55030678d69b.png" alt="" width="477" height="345" /></p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The Forecast Pipeline chart assumes that the sales stages are being used as defined in the out-of-the-box Sales Stage dropdown list. While the dashlet will display custom Sales Stage field values, the out-of-the-box Closed Won and Closed Lost field values must be preserved in order for Sugar's Forecast Pipeline Chart to properly identify open vs. closed business. Any custom stages added to the Sales Stage dropdown by your organization will be displayed at the top of the funnel, regardless of how the stages are sorted within the dropdown.</p>
        <p>Users can customize the Forecast Pipeline Chart to monitor the overall health of their personal funnel or that of their entire team over various time periods. After adding this dashlet to the homepage, toggle between "My Pipeline" and "My Team's Pipeline" using the individual and group icons in the corner of the dashlet. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a8484233-71b8-792c-309e-5503062c54b2.png" alt="" width="499" height="140" /><br /> The pipeline can also be filtered by time periods that have been configured by the administrator in the Forecasts module by clicking on the time period dropdown. The chart will display only records with an expected close date within the specified date range. Hover over the time periods to see the dates that the time periods begin and end.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/6d1d2a3f-0b24-f211-072a-55030653f8c4.png" alt="" width="251" height="143" /></p>
        <p>To further customize the dashlet, users can click on individual sales stage labels to add and remove those stages from the funnel view. In the example pictured below, only the Proposal/Price Quote and Negotiation/Review sales stages are enabled and therefore appear in the legend with solid dots. Sales stages that have been disabled will appear in the legend as empty circles.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a7d4cbc5-a374-363e-10d3-550306cb75c0.png" alt="" width="435" height="309" /></p>

        <p>Additional dashlets can be added by clicking the triangle next to the Create button on the upper right of the dashboard then selecting "Edit". The dashboards edit layout will display open Add a Row boxes where you can add new dashlets. For each row you add, you will also have the option to select columns (+1 column, +2 columns, +3 columns) based on the number of dashlets you wish to display per row. You can select and add from the list of available dashlets (e.g. My Accounts, Sales by Country, etc.) to the specific column on the dashboard row.

        <p>There are various options available when working with dashlets on your Home page including editing dashlets, rearranging dashlets, refreshing dashlets, deleting dashlets, etc. Dashlets on the Home page can easily be configured to display specific information users want to view. Simply click the Gear icon at the top of the dashlet menu bar then select "Edit", which will display the Edit Options page to configure the dashlet per your viewing preference. Users also have the option to rearrange dashlets to place them in different positions on their dashboard. You can easily swap positions between two dashlets by dragging and dropping the dashlets across your dashboard. Please keep in mind that dashlets in Sugar also need to be refreshed in order to view any updated data and there are various options available for users to refresh. In addition, you can also delete dashlets you no longer wish to view on your dashboard by clicking the Gear icon at the top of the dashlet menu bar then selecting "Remove". Please note that deleted dashlets are not permanently removed and can be added back by editing the dashboard. For more information on editing, rearranging, refreshing, and deleting your dashlets, please refer to the <a href="#d03d1-d6ae-25ce-a8e4-551b225ee8d6_Intelligence_Pane">Intelligence Pane</a> documentation.</p>
        <h3 id="c0efb-c46a-70e0-f792-551b22e7d6e8_My_Legacy_Dashboard">My Legacy Dashboard</h3>
        <p>The users existing dashboard in 6.7.x will be migrated over to 7.2 upon upgrade and can be viewed via the My Legacy Dashboard on the Home page. The My Legacy Dashboard enables users to view information from their existing 6.7.x dashlets and allows them to similarly configure dashlets (e.g. My Accounts, My Calls, etc.) that are supported for 7.2 in the new dashboard (e.g. My Dashboard). The overall layout of the legacy dashboard will be the same as it was in 6.7.x, but dashlets such as My Activity Stream, My Project Tasks, and any forecast-specific dashlets will not appear as they are not compatible with 7.x. Please note that the My Activity Stream dashlet does not appear upon upgrade as it is replaced with the new activity stream view on the 7.x Home page. For more information on viewing and managing the activity stream, please refer to the <a href="#c0efb-c46a-70e0-f792-551b22e7d6e8_Activity_Stream">Activity Streams</a> documentation. The legacy dashlets will migrate over with the same configurations applied and will function in similar fashion. For example, you can close meetings from the My Meetings dashlet by clicking the Close icon, click the Pencil icon next to records in the dashlet to edit via the module's record view/detail view, create new calls/meetings in the My Calendar dashlet, etc.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e4d3d02d-e9f3-4b51-6af8-550306aec983.png" alt="" width="738" height="169" /></p>
        <p>Simply click the triangle next to the Sugar cube icon and select "My Legacy Dashboard" to view and access your 6.7.x dashboard. Please note that you will not be able to configure (e.g. change layout, add tabs, add dashlets, etc.) the legacy dashboard, but will be able to modify the existing dashlets by clicking the Edit icon at the top of the dashlet menu bar. This will display the pop-up Options box with various options (e.g. Title, Display Rows, etc.) and filters (e.g. Only My Items, Assigned to, etc.) to make any necessary changes. Unlike 6.7.x, administrators will not be able to configure the Filters options or the dashlet list view display columns via Admin &gt; Studio as the Sugar Dashlet layout in Studio is not available.</p>
        <h2 id="c0efb-c46a-70e0-f792-551b22e7d6e8_Activity_Stream">Activity Stream</h2>
        <p>Sugar's activity stream allows users to view a list of activities performed on records, create posts, preview posts, comment on posts, etc. Users can easily track the most recent updates across their entire organization via the record and user posts on the Home page activity stream. You can also personalize the activity stream by specifying which records' posts you wish to view on the activity stream. Please note that the modules currently enabled to generate record posts for the activity stream are Accounts, Contacts, Leads, Opportunities, Revenue Line Items, Bugs, and Cases. For more information on viewing posts, creating posts, etc. via the activity stream, please refer to the <a href="#c0dd8-1b9d-6cdc-d731-551b22c834a8_Activity_Streams">Activity Streams</a> documentation.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/76e1c3e3-4a9d-cb37-6392-5503060fcc38.png" alt="" width="460" height="399" /></p>

<h2 id="d26-c435-3cc1-7f4c-551b22d48794_Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Sugar's Leads module consists of individual prospects who may be interested in a product or service your organization provides. Once the lead is qualified as a sales opportunity, leads can be converted into contacts, opportunities, and accounts. There are various ways you can create leads in Sugar such as via the Leads module, duplication, importing leads, etc. Once the lead record is created, you can view and edit information pertaining to the lead via the Leads record view. This documentation will go over the basics of the Leads module as well as the various options available in performing the actions related to the module.</p>
<h2 id="d26-c435-3cc1-7f4c-551b22d48794_Lead_Fields">Lead Fields</h2>
<p>The Leads module contains a number of stock fields which come out of the box with Sugar. The below definitions are suggested meanings for the fields, but the fields can be leveraged to best meet your organization's needs. Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to alter, remove, or add fields via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on adding or modifying fields, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Fields">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

        <p>The Leads list view includes a module search to help you locate records easily and effectively in a module-specific manner. Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Leads list view below. Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Please note that Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %smith). This will pull up any record that has the word "smith" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p>
        <p>For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Search">Search</a> documentation.</p>
        <h3 id="d26-c435-3cc1-7f4c-551b22d48794_Module_Search">Module Search</h3>
        <p>Module search enables users to easily search by lead name within the Leads module and pull up matching records in the list view. Records are deemed as matching when their first or last names start with any of the terms entered in the open Search box. The search also provides a Filter option which can be used in combination with the open Search box to narrow your search further using the available options as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Create </strong>: Create a new custom filter which you can use to filter your search
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Note</strong>: You can also click "Create" to the right of the Filter option.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>All Leads</strong> : Returns all records in the module to which you have access</li>
            <li><strong>My Favorites</strong> : Returns only records you have marked as favorites</li>
            <li><strong>My Leads </strong>: Returns only records assigned to you</li>
            <li><strong>Recently Created </strong>: Returns only records you created in the module within the last 7 days</li>
            <li><strong>Recently Viewed </strong>: Returns only records you have viewed in the module within the last 7 days</li>
        </ul>
        <p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/4dcdb677-ea4c-2b84-25dc-550305b2b41a.png" alt="" width="463" height="269" /></p>
        <p>When you choose a filter, Sugar will return leads which match both the selected filter and any name provided in the "Search by first name, last name..." bar in the filtered list view results. For example, if you select "My Leads" in the Filter options and enter a lead name, Sugar will only return lead records with a matching name that are assigned to you. Once the search is complete, the relevant results will populate in the <a href="#d26-c435-3cc1-7f4c-551b22d48794_Leads_List_View">list view</a> below the search bar. To see all lead records to which you have access, simply select the All Leads option in the filter and remove any text from the search bar. You can also click the Clear icon within the selected filter option (e.g. My Leads) in the Search bar to clear the filter and pull up all list view search results. When you run a search using a saved or created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away.</p>

        <p>Please note that you will only be able to see lead records as allowed by your team membership, user access type, and assigned roles. For more information on teams and roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/031_Team_Management">Team Management</a> and <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide.

        <h4 id="d26-c435-3cc1-7f4c-551b22d48794_Creating_a_Filter">Creating a Filter</h4>
        <p>Users can also create new filters via the Create option in the Filter list of the search bar. This allows users to add custom, complex filter options when searching in the Leads list view. You have the option to add multiple fields to your new filter by clicking the Plus button to the right of the filter selection dropdown lists and set select operators along with their value(s). A filter's criteria need to be true for a record in order for it to appear in the list view search result. Additionally, filters with no specified values may be saved as a custom filter to act as a filter template when a user often searches using the same fields but with varying values. Please note that only fields you have view access for will appear in the Filter list when creating a search filter.</p>
        <p>When you run a search using a created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away.</p>
        <p>The following steps cover creating a new Assigned to filter as an example:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click the Filter option on the Leads search bar then select "Create".
                <ul>
                    <li>You can also click "Create" to the right of the Filter option.</li>
                </ul><br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/c310d0f4-6794-28c3-17e4-55030528f480.png" alt="" width="299" height="254" /></li>
            <li>Select the field you wish to add to your filter as well as the condition and matching criteria.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Note</strong>: Only fields you have view access for will be available to add in the Filter list.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>To add additional fields to the new filter, click the Plus button to the right of the filter.
                <ul>
                    <li>To remove fields from the new filter, click the Minus button to the right of the filter.</li>
                    <li>To clear any filter values (e.g. Will Westin), simply click the "x" to the right of the value or select "Reset" to the left of the Save button.</li>
                </ul><br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/6c5f1305-61a5-872c-a70d-5503051ecb61.png" alt="" height="358" width="460" /></li>
        </ol>
        <p>The list view will automatically display results matching your filters as you create and modify the criteria.</p>
        <h4 id="d26-c435-3cc1-7f4c-551b22d48794_Saving_a_Filter">Saving a Filter</h4>
        <p>Saving a filter will preserve the chosen fields as well as the condition(s) of the matching value(s). Additionally, it will allow users to easily select previously created and saved filters from the Filter options.</p>
        <p>The following steps cover saving a new search by Name filter as an example:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a <a href="#d26-c435-3cc1-7f4c-551b22d48794_Creating_a_Filter">new filter</a> to perform a search on your desired fields.</li>
            <li>Enter in a name for the new filter (e.g. "Leads not assigned to Will"). <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/16f1d7e5-9520-7582-c635-550305aa6401.png" alt="" width="461" height="76" /></li>
            <li>Click "Save" to add this filter to the module's Filter options.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="d26-c435-3cc1-7f4c-551b22d48794_Global_Search">Global Search</h3>
        <p>Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Beginning with version 6.5.0, Full Text Search is used with Global Search to search throughout nearly all fields and modules for an enhanced search experience. The Global Search bar is located on the top right hand side of Sugar. You can click the magnifying glass icon or hit Return/Enter to perform your search once the text string is entered in the search box. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/432fc667-fe09-5bc7-ec08-550305c62bd4.png" alt="" width="322" height="42" /></p>
        <p>To use global search, you need to first enter the keyword into the search box and the pop-up results will begin appearing once you enter in at least one character. Clicking the magnifying glass icon or hitting your Return/Enter key will cause Sugar to return exact matches for your keyword rather than matches with words beginning with your keyword. For more information on using and configuring Global Search, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Global_Search">Global Search</a> section of the Search documentation.</p>
        <p>Regular Sugar users can configure some aspects of global search such as what modules are displayed in the search results by clicking the down arrow within the search box then selecting the module(s) to include in the search. For more information on configuring your Global Search, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Advanced_Options">Search</a> documentation. Administrators can control additional elements of global search via Admin &gt; Search and Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on administrator configuration of Global Search, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Field_Options">Field Options</a> section of the Studio documentation as well as the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/05_System#Search">Search</a> section of the System documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

Simply place your cursor on the column divider, and when the Left and Right arrow appears, click and drag the column to the desired size. The set column width will be preserved when you navigate away from the page. Sugar will render the preferred column size across sessions until the user removes or resets the relevant browser cookies. You can reset the column width back to the default size by clicking the Gear icon to the far right of the list view column headers and selecting "Reset default widths". Please note that this option only appears if at least one of the column widths in the current list view is different from the default column width. Changes to the column width made by administrators in Studio are only respected if the user has not resized the specific column in the list view. The column size set by the user will supersede the default column width configured in Studio until the user resets the list view back to the default widths.</p>

        <p>While in Data View, all of the lead record's related records will be displayed beneath the lead record's fields. Users have the ability to search for records which appear in the subpanels as well as filter the view to only display a specific module (e.g. Campaigns). To locate a record by name, enter the keyword into the Search bar, and the subpanel(s) with the matching record(s) will appear below. To filter, simply click the Related option to the far left of the Search bar and select the module whose subpanel you wish to view. Filter and search may be combined to only display matching records within a selected module. To see all subpanels to which you have access, simply select "All" in the Related options and remove any text from the search bar. When you run a search using a saved or created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the page. Returning to the page will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away.</p>

        <p>When a Sidecar module (e.g. Notes, Tasks, etc.) is selected from the Related options, you have the option to filter the related subpanels further using one of the available options (e.g. My Favorites, Recently Created, etc.). Please note that you can also create custom filters for related Sidecar modules. Once the related module (e.g. Tasks) is selected, either click the Filter option and select "Create" or click "Create" to the right of the Filter option.

        <p>Users can easily move subpanels to a new location on the record view by dragging and dropping the subpanel's header. The new subpanel order will remain for a user upon subsequent visits to the module until the user's browser cache is cleared. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/cbafe0dc-a1d3-06ed-571e-550304afa317.png" alt="Reordering_Subpanels" width="647" height="312" /></p>
        <h4 id="d26-c435-3cc1-7f4c-551b22d48794_Related_Record_Subpanels">Related Record Subpanels</h4>
        <p>Modules in Sugar display subpanels, which allow users to view related records from other modules. Users can view the details of the related record as well as relate new or existing records via the subpanel. The most common type of subpanels displayed on a lead's record view contain the lead's related records belonging to various modules. The relationship type determines whether a related record will be displayed in the field listing or in a subpanel. For example, a lead may be related to multiple calls which means that the related call will be displayed in a subpanel beneath the fields.</p>
        <p>Users with administrator or developer access also have the ability to change the fields (e.g. Name, Assigned User, etc.) and labels of each subpanel by configuring the layout via Admin &gt; Studio to provide visibility to the most important fields. For more information on modifying subpanels, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Editing_Subpanels">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
        <p>Related record subpanels allow the following operations to be performed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To view the details of a related record, click the record's name in the subpanel to open it in record view or detail view.</li>
            <li>To relate an existing record to the lead, choose "Link Existing Record" from the subpanel's Action menu, then locate and select the desired record.</li>
            <li>To relate a new record to the lead, click the Plus button to the left of the Actions menu, then complete the record view layout and click "Save".</li>
            <li>To preview the related record for Sidecar modules (e.g. Notes), click the Preview icon to the far right of the record's row in the subpanel.</li>
            <li>To inline edit the record directly from the subpanel, choose "Edit" from the Actions menu on the far right of the record's row and click "Save" to preserve the change. For Legacy module subpanels (e.g. Meetings), click the Pencil icon on the far right of the record's row.</li>

    <div>
        <p>The Emails subpanel in the Leads module displays both emails implicitly and explicitly related to the account record. Emails in Sugar are implicitly related to records in Sugar that match an email address in the From, To, or Cc fields in the email. This implicit relationship is made for emails sent from Sugar as well as any email imported into Sugar via Inbound email accounts or email archiving. While composing an email or relating an existing email to a record, users have the ability to set an explicit relationship via the flex relate field by <a href="#e06b545-5f8a-348a-a1db-556e3f1b53ba_Relating_Emails">Relating Emails</a>. This allows the email to be explicitly related to a single record from one of many modules.</p>
        <p>The Emails subpanel allows the following functions to be performed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To view the details of an email, click the subject in the subpanel to open it in detail view.</li>
            <li>Minimize the subpanel by clicking "^" (up arrow).</li>
            <li>Expand the subpanel by clicking "v" (down arrow).</li>
            <li>Click "+" to create a new email that will have an implicit relationship with this record.</li>
            <li>Sort the emails by Subject, Status, Date Created, Date Modified, or Assigned User.</li>
            <li>Click "More emails" to see any additional emails hidden by the default view. </li>
            <li>To change the column size in the subpanel, place your cursor on the column divider, and when the Left and Right arrow appears, click and drag the column to the desired size.

        <p>The Campaign Log subpanel contains historical information regarding a lead record's interaction with all Sugar campaigns. When a mass marketing campaign is sent to a lead (or manually marked as sent in the case of non-email campaigns), the related campaign activity information will appear within the Campaign Log subpanel. This information mirrors the "View Status" page available from within each individual campaign and shows activities such as when a campaign was sent, when the recipient viewed the campaign message, when the recipient clicked a tracked link within the campaign, etc. Since this subpanel contains historical campaign interactions for the lead, it cannot be used to associate a lead with a campaign or otherwise manage a campaign or target list. For more information on associating a lead with a campaign, please refer to the <a href="#d26-c435-3cc1-7f4c-551b22d48794_Adding_Leads_to_a_Target_List">Adding Leads to a Target List</a> section of this documentation.

        <p>An intelligence pane displays to the right of the lead's record view and provides users with valuable information specific to the lead's activities. The Help Dashboard normally displays by default along with the Record View Help dashlet and Learning Resources dashlet. The Record View Help dashlet provides users with a brief introduction to the module along with some instructions to help users utilize and navigate around the record view. A link to the corresponding documentation (e.g. Leads documentation) in the Application guide is also provided within the Help dashlet. The Learning Resources dashlet includes links to Sugar University, Community Forums, and Documentation &amp; Support, which provide access to additional resources. Simply click the appropriate link to be directed to the specific page in a separate tab. For more information regarding the Help dashboard, please refer to the <a href="#d03d1-d6ae-25ce-a8e4-551b225ee8d6_Viewing_Via_Record_View"><span>Intelligence Pane</span></a> documentation. You can access the My Dashboard, which will display some stock dashlets (e.g. Planned Activities dashlet, History dashlet , etc.) by clicking the triangle to the right of "Help Dashboard" and selecting "My Dashboard". Users may choose to view any of their dashboards using the triangle to the right of the current dashboard's name and may create other dashboards for use with the Leads module by clicking the Create button. Selecting "Edit" from the Actions menu on the upper right will allow them to make changes and add additional dashlets to their dashboards.</p>

        <p>If a lead record is invalid or should no longer appear in your organization's Sugar instance, it may be deleted from either the Leads record view or list view. Deleting via the record view allows you to delete a single record while the list view allows for mass deleting multiple records at once as well as single record deletions. Deleting lead records will not delete the related records and will only remove the relationship, so you may wish to also delete any related records to avoid orphaned records.</p>

        <p>Sugar enables you to convert leads into contacts as you determine they qualify for your organization's definition of a contact (e.g. after an evaluation/qualification process or upon entering into business with the individual). When the lead is converted, a new contact record is created in Sugar with a relationship to the original lead record. The Convert Lead page also gives you the option to create an account and opportunity record. Please note that administrators have the ability to configure the Convert Lead layout via Admin &gt; Studio to mark modules as required for conversion, add additional modules (e.g. Notes, Tasks, etc.) to the convert layout, remove modules, etc. For more information on configuring the convert layout, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Editing_Convert_Lead_Layout">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Sugar automatically checks for any duplicate records (e.g. contacts) in the system when converting the lead. The Convert Lead page will display any Contact, Account, or Opportunity records that are detected as duplicates in a list view within the panels (Contacts, Accounts, Opportunities). Please note that the duplicate check feature is enabled by default in Sugar and cannot be disabled by administrators or users.</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> In the Leads module, the duplicate check ignores leads that have a status of "Converted", allowing you to re-enter leads who may demonstrate interest more than once.</p>
            <p>Users have the option to ignore and create a new record or select the existing record displayed on the Convert Lead page. In addition, the Search bar is available to search for existing records (Contacts, Accounts, etc.) to relate to the lead. For more information on performing searches, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/03_Search#List_View_Search_%28Sidecar_Modules%29">Search</a> documentation. The record view layout will open up on the Convert Lead page when creating a new record to associate to the lead. Please note that you can preview the duplicate record(s) by clicking the Preview icon to the far right of the record's row. Once a new record is created or an existing record is selected, click the Associate button ("Associate Contact", "Associate Account") on the upper right of the panel to relate the record to the lead.</p>

        <p>Once the lead has been evaluated and qualified, they are ready to be converted to a contact in Sugar. Please note that the panel (Contacts, Accounts) on the Convert Lead page must be completed and associated to the lead in order for the succeeding panels to open to associate to the lead record. Once a Contact, Account, or Opportunity record is associated to the lead, the corresponding panel will display a check mark to the left of the header.</p>
        <p>The following steps cover converting a lead to a new contact and relating it to an existing account record as an example:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to a Leads record view.</li>
            <li>Select "Convert" from the Actions menu.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a6eb08fc-621a-6563-a8ea-5503057e4f8f.png" alt="" width="497" height="161" /></li>
            <li>Sugar will perform a duplicate check for any existing contacts and accounts.
                <ul>
                    <li>The duplicate records (if any) will be displayed in a list view within each panel (Contacts, Accounts, Opportunities).</li>
                    <li>Users have the option to ignore and create a new record or select the existing record displayed on the Convert Lead page.</li>
                    <li>You can also perform a search within the module to relate an existing record to the lead.</li>
                    <li><strong>Note</strong>: You can preview duplicate records by clicking the Preview icon to the far right of the record's row prior to relating the record to the lead.

        <p>Sugar's Export option allows users to download all fields for the selected leads to their computers as a .CSV (comma-separated values) file. This may be useful when needing to use Lead data with other software such as Microsoft Excel or to update existing records by exporting, making changes, then importing the altered leads back into Sugar. For more information on updating existing records via import, please refer to the <a href="#f-87f1-f338-50da-551b227d034a_Importing_Updates_to_Existing_Records">Import</a> documentation. Due to PHP memory limitations on the server, there may be occasions when the application times out while exporting a large number of lead records. If you encounter an error when performing this action, we recommend selecting the records in smaller batches.</p>
        <p>Leads may be exported from the Leads list view by selecting "Export" from the Mass Actions menu. Users with access to the Reports module also have the option of creating or accessing reports containing specifically chosen fields for leads and their related record(s). Please note that only Rows and Columns-type reports have the ability to be exported. For more information on exporting records in Sugar, please refer to the <a href="#e6004c-15af-3450-3b7e-551b22bbe5d2_Export">Export</a> documentation.</p>

            <h2 id="d26-c435-3cc1-7f4c-551b22d48794_Finding_Duplicate_Leads">Finding Duplicate Leads</h2>
            <p>Between multiple users working in Sugar, importing new records, and converting leads, it is possible for duplicate lead records to be accidentally input to the system. Before creating a new lead record, a good practice is to first check that the lead does not already exist in Sugar. You can locate duplicate records for cleanup using <a href="#d26-c435-3cc1-7f4c-551b22d48794_Module_Search">module search</a> from the Leads list view. Searching for leads with similar names or other information can turn search into a powerful, duplicates-finding tool. Sugar also provides a wizard for finding potential duplicates that is available from the Leads record view and may be used as shown below. If duplicate lead records are detected, you can perform a merge per the <a href="#d26-c435-3cc1-7f4c-551b22d48794_Merging_Leads">Merging Leads</a> section of this documentation.</p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> In the Leads module, the duplicate check ignores leads that have a status of "Converted", allowing you to re-enter leads who may demonstrate interest more than once.</p>
            <p>Please note that your ability to use the Find Duplicates action may be restricted by any role which prevents lead deletion. For more information on roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide. Check with your system administrator if you do not see the Find Duplicates option.</p>
            <p>Use the following steps to locate duplicate leads using the Find Duplicates option from the Leads record view:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Navigate to an lead's record view.</li>
                <li>Choose "Find Duplicates" from the Actions menu.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/45912dc6-0505-f85e-76fd-550305057f3e.png" alt="" width="400" height="243" /></li>
                <li>Potential duplicate lead records will be listed on the Find Duplicates page. Select the duplicate record(s) you wish to merge then click "Merge Duplicates".
                    <ul>
                        <li>You can preview the duplicate record's details by clicking the Preview button to the far right of the records row.</li>
                        <li>You can search for specific records from the Leads list view if you wish to check for more possible duplicates. For more information on performing a search, please refer to the <a href="#d26-c435-3cc1-7f4c-551b22d48794_Module_Search">Module Search</a> section of this documentation.</li>
                        <li>You can also click the Column Selection icon above the Preview button to change the list of fields that display on the list view column headers.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>Once you click "Merge Duplicates", the merging process with the current record will begin. For instructions on performing the merge that follows, please refer to Steps 3-9 of the <a href="#d26-c435-3cc1-7f4c-551b22d48794_Merging_Via_List_View">Merging Via List View</a> section of this documentation.</p>

            <p>When duplicate records are identified in Sugar, you have the option to merge two or more duplicate leads into a single record. Once the merge is complete, the duplicate lead record(s) will be deleted, and the primary record will remain. Please note that all relationships belonging to the duplicate leads will be merged to the primary record meaning that any calls, meetings, etc. related to the duplicate lead record(s) will automatically be related to the resulting, merged lead record. </p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Date Created, Date Modified, and Password field types are not supported when merging duplicate records in Sugar.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Select "Merge" from the Actions menu to display the Merging Records page. The primary record's field values are displayed on the left while other record's values are in columns to the right. For convenience, fields with differing values will appear on the top of the list.

                <li>If 3 or more records are selected to be merged, an X icon will appear at the top right of each record. Clicking the "X" will remove the record from the merge process but will not delete the record.</li>
                <li>To change which record is considered the primary, drag and drop the Primary label on the top of a different column.</li>
                <li>Review the field values in each column and click the radio button to the left of the value that should appear on the final record. You can also manually type or select a new value for any field as necessary.

                    <p>The D&amp;B: Build A List Preview dashboard to the right of the page will display search results in real time as you enter in the various search filter criteria. Only individuals meeting all of the search criteria across all panels on the D&amp;B Build A List page will be included in the search results. The first ten matching individuals will display in the Leads dashlet, and you can click "Show More D&amp;B Search Results" at the bottom of the dashlet to display the other individuals.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/7c694f50-194c-de2a-4bfc-550305832f52.png" alt="" width="832" height="447" /></p>
                    <p>To import an individual, simply select the appropriate individual's name in the Leads dashlet and their key information (e.g. name, title, etc.) will display in the D&amp;B: Lead Information dashlet. To return back to the previous search results, simply click "Back To D&amp;B Contacts List" at the bottom of the D&amp;B: Lead Information dashlet. To import the individual's data into Sugar, click the Import button on the upper right of the dashlet. The individual's data will appear in the corresponding Sugar fields in the lead's record view. In addition, the D&amp;B Principal ID number associated to the individual in D&amp;B will be populated automatically in the D&amp;B Principal ID field of the lead's record view. The D&amp;B Principal <span>ID</span> is used to identify the individual and detect duplicate records, so any record(s) in the dashlet detected as a duplicate of an existing record in Sugar will display "Duplicate" to the right of the individual's name. Sugar will also display any duplicate record(s) detected based on the D&amp;B Principal <span>ID</span> when attempting to save the record.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b87b257b-1dc0-f450-bee4-55030585fbf7.png" alt="" width="320" height="348" /></p>
                    <p>Please note that if the selected individual is detected as a duplicate of an existing Sugar record, the duplicate record(s) will appear within the record view upon save, but you can click "Ignore Duplicate and Save" if you wish to proceed with creating the record. You can also choose to view and edit the duplicate record's details by clicking "Select and edit" in the panel. Please note that each individual will need to be imported one-at-a-time. Once the individual is imported to Sugar, you will be taken back to the Build A List page where your search filter criteria are still preserved and you can select other individuals to import from the results list.</p>

<h2 id="b2ae-4a0f-bfc1-551b22266814_Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Sugar's Contacts module consists of individual people with whom your organization has a relationship. Contact records are typically related to an account record, and multiple contacts may be associated to a single account. There are various ways you can create contacts in Sugar such as via the Contacts module, importing contacts, converting leads to contacts, etc. Once the contact record is created, you can view and edit information pertaining to the contact via the Contacts record view. Each contact record may then relate to other Sugar records such as meetings, cases, opportunities, and many others, making the contact record a hub for viewing and continuing your interaction with the individual. This documentation will cover how to use the Contacts module as well as the various actions and options available from within the module.</p>
<h2 id="b2ae-4a0f-bfc1-551b22266814_Contact_Fields">Contact Fields</h2>
<p>The Contacts module contains a number of stock fields which come out-of-the-box with Sugar. The below definitions are suggested meanings for the fields, but the fields can be leveraged differently to best meet your organization's needs. Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to alter, add, or remove fields via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on configuring fields, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Fields">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

<p>If you do not see the Contacts module tab in Sugar, please check the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Contacts module may be marked as hidden in your user preferences which will prevent the module tab from being displayed. Navigate to your user profile (upper right of Sugar), click the Advanced tab, and check the Layout Options section. If you see the Contacts module in the Hide Modules list, simply move it to the Display Modules list and save. For more information on hiding and displaying modules, please refer to the <a href="#e-543f-551b22c2c01c_Layout_Options">Layout Options</a> section of the Getting Started documentation.</li>
    <li>The administrator may have disabled the Contacts module for your entire Sugar instance. Reach out to your Sugar administrator to have the Contacts module displayed.

<h2 id="b2ae-4a0f-bfc1-551b22266814_Creating_Contacts">Creating Contacts</h2>
<p>There are various methods for creating contacts in Sugar including via the Contacts module, quick create, vCard, duplication, emails, importing contacts, and converting leads to contacts. The full record view layout opens when creating the contact directly from the Contacts menu and includes all of the relevant fields for your organization's contacts. The quick create form is a shortened version of the contacts record view and typically contains fewer fields. When using quick create to make a contact while viewing an existing record of another module, Sugar automatically creates a relationship between both records. For example, if you are viewing an account record (e.g. ABC Company) and create a new contact via the quick create form, the Account Name field in the contact record will automatically populate with "ABC Company", thus creating the relationship. Both the Record View and Quick Create layouts can be configured by administrators via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on configuring layouts, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Layouts">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<h3 id="b2ae-4a0f-bfc1-551b22266814_Creating_Via_Contacts_Module">Creating Via Contacts Module</h3>
<p>One of the most common methods of contact creation is via the Create Contact option in the Contacts module tab. This opens up the record view layout which allows you to enter in all the relevant information for the contact. <br />Use the following steps to create a contact via the Contacts module:</p>

<h2 id="b2ae-4a0f-bfc1-551b22266814_Searching_Contacts">Searching Contacts</h2>
<p>The Contacts list view includes a module search to help you locate records easily and effectively in a module-specific manner. Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Contacts list view below. Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Please note that Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %smith). This will pull up any record that has the word "smith" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p>
<p>For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Search">Search</a> documentation.</p>
<h3 id="b2ae-4a0f-bfc1-551b22266814_Module_Search">Module Search</h3>
<p>Module search enables users to easily search by Contact name within the Contacts module and pull up matching records in the list view. Records are deemed as matching when their first or last names start with any of the terms entered in the open Search box. The search also provides a Filter option which can be used in combination with the open Search box to narrow your search further using the available options as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Create </strong>: Create a new custom filter which you can use to filter your search
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Note</strong>: You can also click "Create" to the right of the Filter option.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>All Contacts</strong> : Returns all records in the module to which you have access</li>
    <li><strong>My Contacts </strong>: Returns only records assigned to you</li>
    <li><strong>My Favorites</strong> : Returns only records you have marked as favorites</li>
    <li><strong>Recently Created </strong>: Returns only records you created in the module within the last 7 days</li>
    <li><strong>Recently Viewed </strong>: Returns only records you have viewed in the module within the last 7 days</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/c5923f1b-2d39-406f-e989-5503078e07a0.png" alt="" width="437" height="269" /></p>
<p>When you choose a filter, Sugar will return contacts which match both the selected filter and any name provided in the "Search by first name, last name..." bar in the filtered list view results. For example, if you select "My Contacts" in the Filter options and enter a contact name, Sugar will only return contact records with a matching name that are assigned to you. Once the search is complete, the relevant results will populate in the <a href="#b2ae-4a0f-bfc1-551b22266814_Contacts_List_View">list view</a> below the search bar. To see all contact records to which you have access, simply select the All Contacts option in the filter and remove any text from the search bar. You can also click the Clear icon within the selected filter option (e.g. My Contacts) in the Search bar to clear the filter and pull up all list view search results. When you run a search using a saved or created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/14b30805-f096-3fbd-536d-550307d2c3ed.png" alt="" height="134" width="397" /></p>

<p>Users can also create new filters via the Create option in the Filter list of the search bar. This allows users to add custom, complex filter options when searching in the Contacts list view. You have the option to add multiple fields to your new filter by clicking the Plus button to the right of the filter selection dropdown lists and set select operators along with their value(s). A filter's criteria need to be true for a record in order for it to appear in the list view search result. Additionally, filters with no specified values may be saved as a custom filter to act as a filter template when a user often searches using the same fields but with varying values. Please note that only fields you have view access for will appear in the Filter list when creating a search filter.</p>
<p>When you run a search using a created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module.

<h3 id="b2ae-4a0f-bfc1-551b22266814_Global_Search">Global Search</h3>
<p>Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Beginning with version 6.5.0, Full Text Search may be used with Global Search to search throughout nearly all fields and modules for an enhanced search experience. The Global Search bar is located on the top right hand side of Sugar. You can click the magnifying glass icon or hit Return/Enter to perform your search once the text string is entered in the search box. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/1c367e6f-3780-e1c6-67aa-55030737fc86.png" alt="" width="366" height="50" /></p>
<p>To use global search, you need to first enter the keyword into the search box and the pop-up results will begin appearing once you enter in at least one character. Clicking the magnifying glass icon or hitting your Return/Enter key will cause Sugar to return exact matches for your keyword rather than matches with words beginning with your keyword. For more information on using and configuring Global Search, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Global_Search">Global Search</a> section of the Search documentation. <br />Regular Sugar users can configure some aspects of global search such as what modules are displayed in the search results by clicking the down arrow within the Search box then selecting the module(s) to include in the search. For more information on configuring your Global Search, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Advanced_Options">Search</a> documentation. Administrators can control additional elements of global search via Admin &gt; Search and Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on administrator configuration of Global Search, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Field_Options">Field Options</a> section of the Studio documentation as well as the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/05_System#Search">Search</a> section of the System documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

<h3 id="b2ae-4a0f-bfc1-551b22266814_Favorite_Designation">Favorite Designation</h3>
<p>Users have the option to mark contact records as a favorite via the record view as well as the list view. This allows users to designate records that are important or will be viewed often so that they can easily be accessed via search or from the Contacts module tab. In the Contact's record view, the star on the right of the contact's name is yellow once marked to indicate a favorite contact. For more information on how to mark records as favorites, please refer to the <a href="#b2ae-4a0f-bfc1-551b22266814_Favoriting_Contacts">Favoriting Contacts</a> section of this documentation. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/76b8e4b1-f324-f35c-0ea7-55030742c58b.png" alt="" width="250" height="51" /></p>
<h3 id="b2ae-4a0f-bfc1-551b22266814_Following_Designation">Following Designation</h3>
<p>Users also have the option to follow contact records via the record view or list view. This allows users to view record posts from followed contacts on their Home page and Contacts list view activity streams. Each user can personalize their activity stream by viewing posts for records that are most important to them. From the record view, users may follow or unfollow contacts to which they have access using the Follow button to the right of the contact's name. For more information on how to mark records to follow via the list view, please refer to the <a href="#b2ae-4a0f-bfc1-551b22266814_Record_Actions_Menu">Record Actions Menu</a> section of this documentation.

<h3 id="b2ae-4a0f-bfc1-551b22266814_Show_More">Show More</h3>
<p>The Contacts record view typically display a few key fields (e.g. website, industry, office phone, etc.) on the business card panel with the option to view more fields by clicking the Show More link on the bottom left. Please note that administrators can configure what fields appear on the business card panel via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on editing layouts, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Layouts">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/ea35aac4-cdce-78e7-6e18-550307682c2d.png" alt="" width="450" height="228" /></p>
<h3 id="b2ae-4a0f-bfc1-551b22266814_Subpanels">Subpanels</h3>
<p>Beneath a contact record's fields are subpanels containing related records from various modules, campaign interaction history for this contact, and the contact's InsideView information.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/30288f00-374c-9748-e2ce-550307faf682.png" alt="" width="600" height="169" /></p>
<h4 id="b2ae-4a0f-bfc1-551b22266814_Filter_Options">Filter Options</h4>
<p>While in Data View, all of the contact record's related records will be displayed beneath the contact record's fields. Users have the ability to search for records which appear in the subpanels as well as filter the view to only display a specific module (e.g. Leads, Opportunities, etc.). To locate a record by name, enter the keyword into the Search bar, and the subpanel(s) with the matching record(s) will appear below. To filter, simply click the Related option to the far left of the Search bar and select the module whose subpanel you wish to view. Filter and search may be combined to only display matching records within a selected module. To see all subpanels to which you have access, simply select "All" in the Related options and remove any text from the search bar. When you run a search using a saved or created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the page. Returning to the page will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/7ba70e12-d6c4-b4b3-4e5c-550307512677.png" alt="" width="581" height="139" /></p>
<p>When a Sidecar module (e.g. Opportunities, Leads, Tasks, etc.) is selected from the Related options, you have the option to filter the related subpanels further using one of the available options (e.g. My Favorites, Recently Created, etc.). Please note that you can also create custom filters for related Sidecar modules. Once the related module (e.g. Leads) is selected, either click the Filter option and select "Create" or click "Create" to the right of the Filter option. For more information on creating a related records filter, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Creating_a_Related_Records_Filter">Creating a Related Records Filter</a> section of the Search documentation.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/3bedad64-35be-ee96-2925-550307c7d167.png" alt="" height="216" width="415" /></p>
<h4 id="b2ae-4a0f-bfc1-551b22266814_Reordering_Subpanels">Reordering Subpanels</h4>
<p>Users can easily move subpanels to a new location on the record view by dragging and dropping the subpanel's header. The new subpanel order will remain for a user upon subsequent visits to the module until the user's browser cache is cleared. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/cbafe0dc-a1d3-06ed-571e-550304afa317.png" alt="Reordering_Subpanels" width="642" height="310" /></p>
<h4 id="b2ae-4a0f-bfc1-551b22266814_Related_Record_Subpanels">Related Record Subpanels</h4>
<p>The most common type of subpanels displayed on a contact's record view contain the contact's related records belonging to various modules. The relationship type determines whether a related record will be displayed in the field listing or in a subpanel. For example, a contact may be related to only one account but related to multiple opportunities. This means that the related account will be displayed amongst the contact's fields while opportunities will be displayed in a subpanel beneath the fields.</p>
<p>Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to change the fields (e.g. Subject, Status, etc.) and labels of each subpanel by configuring the layout via Admin &gt; Studio to provide visibility to the most important fields. For more information on modifying subpanels, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio/#Editing_Subpanels">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<p>Related record subpanels allow the following operations to be performed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To view the details of a related record, click the record's name in the subpanel to open it in record view.</li>
    <li>To relate an existing record to the contact, choose "Link Existing Record" from the subpanel's Actions menu, then locate and select the desired record.</li>
    <li>To relate a new record to the contact, click the Plus button to the left of the Actions menu, then complete the record view layout and click "Save".</li>
    <li>To preview the related record, click the Preview icon to the far right of the record's row in the subpanel.</li>
    <li>To inline edit the record directly from the subpanel, choose "Edit" from the Actions menu on the far right of the record's row and click "Save" to preserve the change.</li>
    <li>To delete the contact's relationship to a record, choose "Unlink" from the Actions menu on the far right of the record's row. This removes the relationship, but does not delete the record itself.</li>
    <li>To mark the record as a favorite, click the star icon to the left of the desired record's row.</li>
    <li>To collapse or expand the subpanel, click the Up arrow to the left of the Plus button.</li>
    <li>To change the column size in the subpanel, place your cursor on the column divider and when the Left and Right arrow appears, click and drag the column to the desired size. Please note that the column width will not be preserved when you navigate away from the page.</li>

<h4 id="b2ae-4a0f-bfc1-551b22266814_Emails_Subpanel">Emails Subpanel</h4>
<p>The Emails subpanel in the [Module Name] module displays both emails implicitly and explicitly related to the account record. Emails in Sugar are implicitly related to records in Sugar that match an email address in the From, To, or Cc fields in the email. This implicit relationship is made for emails sent from Sugar as well as any email imported into Sugar via Inbound email accounts or email archiving. While composing an email or relating an existing email to a record, users have the ability to set an explicit relationship via the flex relate field by <a href="#e06b545-5f8a-348a-a1db-556e3f1b53ba_Relating_Emails">Relating Emails</a>. This allows the email to be explicitly related to a single record from one of many modules.</p>
<p>The Emails subpanel allows the following functions to be performed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To view the details of an email, click the subject in the subpanel to open it in detail view.</li>
    <li>Minimize the subpanel by clicking "^" (up arrow).</li>
    <li>Expand the subpanel by clicking "v" (down arrow).</li>
    <li>Click "+" to create a new email that will have an implicit relationship with this record.</li>
    <li>Sort the emails by Subject, Status, Date Created, Date Modified, or Assigned User.</li>
    <li>Click "More emails" to see any additional emails hidden by the default view.</li>
    <li>To change the column size in the subpanel, place your cursor on the column divider, and when the Left and Right arrow appears, click and drag the column to the desired size.

<h4 id="b2ae-4a0f-bfc1-551b22266814_Campaign_Logs_Subpanel">Campaign Logs Subpanel</h4>
<p>The Campaign Logs subpanel contains historical information regarding a contact record's interaction with all Sugar campaigns. When a mass marketing campaign is sent to a contact (or manually marked as sent in the case of non-email campaigns), the related campaign activity information will appear within the Campaign Logs subpanel. This information mirrors the "View Status" page available from within each individual campaign and shows activities such as when a campaign was sent, when the contact viewed the campaign message, when the contact clicked a tracked link within the campaign, etc. Since this subpanel contains historical campaign interactions for the contact, it cannot be used to associate a contact with a campaign or otherwise manage a campaign or target list. For more information on associating a contact with a campaign, please refer to the <a href="#b2ae-4a0f-bfc1-551b22266814_Adding_Contacts_to_a_Target_List">Adding Contacts to a Target List</a> section of this documentation. For more information on campaigns, please refer to the <a href="#e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Campaigns">Campaigns</a> documentation.</p>
<p>The Campaign Log subpanel allows the following functions to be performed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To view the details of a campaign, click the campaign's name in the subpanel to open it in detail view.</li>
    <li>Sort the campaigns by Campaign Name, Activity Type, Activity Date, or Related.</li>
    <li>To collapse or expand the subpanel, click the Up arrow to the left of the Plus button.</li>
    <li>To load the next set of records in the subpanel, click the More campaign log link on the bottom left of the subpanel.</li>

<p>Record view's activity stream displays user posts and record posts specific to the individual contact record. To view the record's activity stream, simply click the Activity Stream button below the contact's fields. Please note that posts added via the record view activity stream are only viewable within that record view unless a user is following the record. For more information on how to add posts to the activity stream, please refer to the <a href="#c0dd8-1b9d-6cdc-d731-551b22c834a8_Activity_Streams">Activity Streams</a> documentation. You can add comments to posts by clicking the Comment button to the far right of each post, entering your comment, then clicking "Reply". You can also preview the record referenced in the record post by clicking the Preview button. The activity stream can also be filtered to only display certain messages (e.g. Messages for Create, Messages for Update, etc.) by clicking "Filter" above the post input box then selecting the desired message type.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/91aace42-6bc2-9c7e-5ffe-5503079dd8bd.png" alt="" width="500" height="250" /></p>

<p>An intelligence pane displays to the right of the contact's record view and provides users with valuable information specific to the contact's interaction, activities, etc. The Help Dashboard normally displays by default along with the Record View Help dashlet and Learning Resources dashlet. The Record View Help dashlet provides users with a brief introduction to the module along with some instructions to help users utilize and navigate around the record view. A link to the corresponding documentation (e.g. Contacts documentation) in the Application guide is also provided within the Help dashlet. The Learning Resources dashlet includes links to Sugar University, Community Forums, and Documentation &amp; Support, which provide access to additional resources. Simply click the appropriate link to be directed to the specific page in a separate tab. For more information regarding the Help dashboard, please refer to the <a href="#d03d1-d6ae-25ce-a8e4-551b225ee8d6_Viewing_Via_Record_View">Intelligence Pane</a> documentation. You can access the My Dashboard, which will display some stock dashlets (e.g. Planned Activities dashlet, History dashlet , etc.) by clicking the triangle to the right of "Help Dashboard" and selecting "My Dashboard". Users may choose to view any of their dashboards using the triangle to the right of the current dashboard's name and may create other dashboards for use with the Contacts module by clicking the Create button. Selecting "Edit" from the Actions menu on the upper right will allow them to make changes and add additional dashlets to their dashboards.</p>
<p>Users can edit individual dashlets by clicking the Gear icon on the upper right of each dashlet. Dashlets may also be dragged and dropped to rearrange them within the current dashboard. You can collapse dashlets you do not wish to view by clicking the Up arrow on the upper right of the dashlet. Sugar will remember the state of your intelligence pane the next time you return to the Contacts module.

<h2 id="b2ae-4a0f-bfc1-551b22266814_Deleting_Contacts">Deleting Contacts</h2>
<p>If a contact record is invalid or should no longer appear in your organization's Sugar instance, it may be deleted from either the Contact's record view or list view. Deleting via the record view allows you to delete a single record while the list view allows for mass deleting multiple records at once. Deleting contact records will not delete the related records and will only remove the relationship, so you may wish to also delete any related records to avoid orphaned records.</p>
<p>Please note that your ability to delete contacts may be restricted by a role.

<h2 id="b2ae-4a0f-bfc1-551b22266814_Exporting_Contacts">Exporting Contacts</h2>
<p>Sugar's Export option allows users to download all fields for the selected contacts to their computers as a .CSV (comma-separated values) file. This may be useful when needing to use Contact data with other software such as Microsoft Excel or to update existing records by exporting, making changes, then importing the altered contacts back into Sugar. For more information on updating existing records via import, please refer to the <a href="#f-87f1-f338-50da-551b227d034a_Importing_Updates_to_Existing_Records">Import</a> documentation.Due to PHP memory limitations on the server, there may be occasions when the application times out while exporting a large number of contact records. If you encounter an error when performing this action, we recommend selecting the records in smaller batches.</p>
<p>Contacts may be exported from the Contacts list view by selecting "Export" from the Actions menu. Users with access to the Reports module also have the option of creating or accessing reports containing specifically chosen fields for contacts and their related record(s).

<h2 id="b2ae-4a0f-bfc1-551b22266814_Finding_Duplicate_Contacts">Finding Duplicate Contacts</h2>
<p>Between multiple users working in Sugar, importing new records, and converting leads, it is possible for duplicate contact records to be accidentally input to the system. Before creating a new contact record, a good practice is to first check that the contact does not already exist in Sugar. You can locate duplicate records for cleanup using <a href="#b2ae-4a0f-bfc1-551b22266814_Module_Search">module search</a> from the Contacts list view. Searching for contacts with similar names or other information can turn search into a powerful, duplicates-finding tool. Sugar also provides a wizard for finding potential duplicates that is available from the Contacts record view and may be used as shown below. If duplicate contact records are detected, you can perform a merge per the <a href="#b2ae-4a0f-bfc1-551b22266814_Merging_Contacts">Merging Contacts</a> section of this documentation.</p>
<p>Please note that your ability to use the Find Duplicates action may be restricted by any role which prevents contact deletion. For more information on roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide. Check with your system administrator if you do not see the Find Duplicates option.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to locate duplicate contacts using the Find Duplicates option from the Contacts record view:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to an contact's record view.</li>
    <li>Choose "Find Duplicates" from the Actions menu.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/92bb5c80-7cbf-a188-8979-5503074a507f.png" alt="" width="400" height="222" /></li>
    <li>Potential duplicate contact records will be listed on the Find Duplicates page. Select the duplicate record(s) you wish to merge then click "Merge Duplicates".
        <ul>
            <li>You can preview the duplicate record's details by clicking the Preview button to the far right of the records row.</li>
            <li>You can search for specific records from the Contacts list view if you wish to check for more possible duplicates. For more information on performing a search, please refer to the <a href="#b2ae-4a0f-bfc1-551b22266814_Module_Search">Module Search</a> section of this documentation.</li>
            <li>You can also click the Column Selection icon above the Preview button to change the list of fields that display on the list view column headers.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

<p>Once you click "Merge Duplicates", the merging process with the current record will begin. For instructions on performing the merge that follows, please refer to Steps 3-9 of the <a href="#b2ae-4a0f-bfc1-551b22266814_Merging_Via_List_View">Merging Via List View</a> section of this documentation.</p>
<h2 id="b2ae-4a0f-bfc1-551b22266814_Merging_Contacts">Merging Contacts</h2>
<p>When duplicate records are identified in Sugar, you have the option to merge two or more contacts into a single record. Once the merge is complete, the duplicate contact record(s) will be deleted, and the primary record will remain. Please note that all relationships belonging to the duplicate contacts will be merged to the primary record meaning that any calls, meetings, cases, etc. related to the duplicate contact record(s) will automatically be related to the resulting, merged contact record.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Date Created, Date Modified, and Password field types are not supported when merging duplicate records in Sugar.</p>

    <li>Select "Merge" from the Actions menu to display the Merging Records page. The primary record's field values are displayed on the left while other record's values are in columns to the right. For convenience, fields with differing values will appear on the top of the list. Saving the merge will preserve only the field values marked with the radio button into a single record.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Note</strong>: The Password field is not available for merge in Sugar.</li>
        </ul><br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/c1ed1cdc-007f-7247-5754-5503074b993d.png" alt="" width="650" height="308" />
        <p>If 3 or more records are selected to be merged, an X icon will appear at the top right of each record. Clicking the "X" will remove the record from the merge process but will not delete the record.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>To change which record is considered the primary, drag and drop the Primary label on the top of a different column.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Review the field values in each column and click the radio button to the left of the value that should appear on the final record. You can also manually type or select a new value for any field as necessary.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Note</strong>: Fields you do not have Edit access for cannot be edited on the merging records page.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Preview what the final, merged record will contain as you work by clicking the eye icon to display the preview in the Intelligence Pane.</li>
    <li>Click "Save" once all fields you wish to appear on the single, merged record have their radio buttons selected.</li>
    <li>A pop-up message will display confirming that the duplicate record(s) should be deleted. Click "Confirm" to proceed.</li>

    <p>Sugar's Accounts module consists of companies with whom your organization has a relationship and is generally seen as the hub for managing and analyzing your business' interactions with each customer. There are various ways you can create accounts in Sugar such as via the Accounts module, duplication, importing accounts, etc. Once the account record is created, you can view and edit information pertaining to the account via the Accounts record view. Each account record may then relate to other Sugar records such as contacts, meetings, cases, opportunities, and many others as the customer's relationship matures. This documentation will cover how to use the Accounts module, as well as the various actions and options available from within the module.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="c-35ef-c853-bcfd-551b22d5c5ac_Account_Fields">Account Fields</h2>
<p>The Accounts module contains a number of stock fields which come out-of-the-box with Sugar. The below definitions are suggested meanings for the fields, but the fields can be leveraged differently to best meet your organization's needs. Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to alter, add, or remove fields via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on configuring fields, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Fields">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

        <p>Users with access to the Reports module can build, run, and manage reports to gather key data regarding accounts and their related records. In addition to only displaying desired fields and relationships, reports can also incorporate complex filters to only display specific subsets of your records. Once the report is run, you will be able to view the accounts record view by clicking the account's name in the report results. Please note that you can only directly access record views with Rows and Columns-type and Summation with Details-type reports as Summation-type and Matrix-type reports do not include hyperlinks in their display columns.

    <div>
        <div>
            <div>
                <p>The Accounts list view includes a module search to help you locate records easily and effectively in a module-specific manner. Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Accounts list view below. Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Please note that Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %services). This will pull up any record that has the word "services" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p>
                <p>For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Search">Search</a> documentation.</p>

                    <p>Module search enables users to easily search by account name within the Accounts module and pull up matching records in the list view. The search also provides a Filter option which can be used in combination with the open Search box to narrow your search further using the available options as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Create</strong> : Create a new custom filter which you can use to filter your search
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Note</strong>: You can also click "Create" to the right of the Filter option.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>All Accounts</strong> : Returns all records in the module to which you have access</li>
                        <li><strong>My Accounts </strong>: Returns only records assigned to you</li>
                        <li><strong>My Favorites</strong> : Returns only records you have marked as favorites</li>
                        <li><strong>Recently Created </strong>: Returns only records you created in the module within the last 7 days</li>
                        <li><strong>Recently Viewed </strong>: Returns only records you have viewed in the module within the last 7 days</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/ce2ec50f-32fe-232a-293d-550286007539.png" alt="" width="440" height="261" /></p>
                    <p>When you choose a filter, Sugar will return accounts which match both the selected filter and any name provided in the "Search by name..." bar in the filtered list view results. For example, if you select "My Accounts" in the Filter options and enter an account name, Sugar will only return account records with a matching name that are assigned to you. Once the search is complete, the relevant results will populate in the <a href="#c-35ef-c853-bcfd-551b22d5c5ac_Accounts_List_View">list view</a> below the search bar. To see all account records to which you have access, simply select the All Accounts option in the filter and remove any text from the search bar. You can also click the Clear icon within the selected filter option (e.g. My Accounts) in the Search bar to clear the filter and pull up all list view search results. When you run a search using a saved or created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the "Search by name..." bar only are not preserved when navigating away. </p>

                    <p>Users can also create new filters via the Create option in the Filter list of the search bar. This allows users to add custom, complex filter options when searching in the Accounts list view. You have the option to add multiple fields to your new filter by clicking the Plus button to the right of the filter selection dropdown lists and set select operators along with their value(s). A filter's criteria need to be true for a record in order for it to appear in the list view search result. Additionally, filters with no specified values may be saved as a custom filter to act as a filter template when a user often searches using the same fields but with varying values. Please note that only fields you have view access for will appear in the Filter list when creating a search filter.</p>
                    <p>When you run a search using a created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away.</p>
                    <p>The following steps cover creating a new Assigned to filter as an example:</p>

                        <li>Select the field you wish to add to your filter as well as the condition and matching criteria.
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Note</strong>: Only fields you have view access for will be available to add in the Filter list.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>To add additional fields to the new filter, click the Plus button to the right of the filter.
                            <ul>
                                <li>To remove fields from the new filter, click the Minus button to the right of the filter.</li>
                                <li>To clear any filter values (e.g. Will Westin), simply click the "x" to the right of the value or select "Reset" to the left of the Save button.</li>
                            </ul><br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/1ee5cbce-9be8-eeee-cf85-550286c6e064.png" alt="" width="462" height="309" /></li>

                    <li>Enter in a name for the new filter (e.g. "Accounts not assigned to Will"). <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/9c58ca14-2f31-8d9b-f02b-550302a54cc5.png" alt="" width="482" height="73" /></li>
                    <li>Click "Save" to add this filter to the module's Filter options.</li>

                <p>Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Beginning with version 6.5.0, Full Text Search is used with Global Search to search throughout nearly all fields and modules for an enhanced search experience. The Global Search bar is located on the top right hand side of Sugar. You can click the magnifying glass icon or hit Return/Enter to perform your search once the text string is entered in the search box.</p>
                <p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/45000f9c-5b11-a0be-854c-550302b230fa.png" alt="" width="319" height="42" /></p>
                <p>To use global search, you need to first enter the keyword into the search box and the pop-up results will begin appearing once you enter in at least one character. Clicking the magnifying glass icon or hitting your Return/Enter key will cause Sugar to return exact matches for your keyword rather than matches with words beginning with your keyword. For more information on using and configuring Global Search, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Global_Search">Global Search</a> section of the Search documentation.</p>
                <p>Regular Sugar users can configure some aspects of global search such as what modules are displayed in the search results by clicking the down arrow within the search box then selecting the module(s) to include in the search. For more information on configuring your Global Search, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Advanced_Options">Search</a> documentation.

The new column order will remain for a user upon subsequent visits to the module until the user's browser cache is cleared. You can reset the column order back to the default view by clicking the Gear icon to the far right of the list view column headers and selecting "Reset default view". Please note that this option only appears if the current list view column order is different from the default column order.</p>

Simply place your cursor on the column divider, and when the Left and Right arrow appears, click and drag the column to the desired size. The set column width will be preserved when you navigate away from the page. Sugar will render the preferred column size across sessions until the user removes or resets the relevant browser cookies. You can reset the column width back to the default size by clicking the Gear icon to the far right of the list view column headers and selecting "Reset default widths". Please note that this option only appears if at least one of the column widths in the current list view is different from the default column width. Changes to the column width made by administrators in Studio are only respected if the user has not resized the specific column in the list view. The column size set by the user will supersede the default column width configured in Studio until the user resets the list view back to the default widths.</p>

                            <p>The most common type of subpanels displayed on an account's record view contain the account's related records belonging to various modules. The relationship type determines whether a related record will be displayed in the field listing or in a subpanel. For example, an account may be related to multiple contacts which means that the related contacts will be displayed in a subpanel beneath the fields.</p>
                            <p>Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to change the fields (e.g. Name, Assigned User, etc.) and labels of each subpanel by configuring the layout via Admin &gt; Studio to provide visibility to the most important fields. For more information on modifying subpanels, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Editing_Subpanels">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
                            <p>Related record subpanels allow the following operations to be performed:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>To view the details of a related record, click the record's name in the subpanel to open it in record view.</li>
                                <li>To relate an existing record to the account, choose "Link Existing Record" from the subpanel's Action menu, then locate and select the desired record. Please note that the Link Existing Record option is not available when the relationship is required in the related module (e.g. Opportunities).</li>
                                <li>To relate a new record to the account, click the Plus button to the left of the Actions menu, then complete the record view layout and click "Save".</li>
                                <li>To preview the related record, click the Preview icon to the far right of the record's row in the subpanel.</li>
                                <li>To inline edit the record directly from the subpanel, choose "Edit" from the Actions menu on the far right of the record's row and click "Save" to preserve the change.</li>
                                <li>To delete the account's relationship to a record, choose "Unlink" from the Actions menu on the far right of the record's row. This removes the relationship, but does not delete the record itself. Please note that the Unlink option is not available when the relationship is required in the related module (e.g. Opportunities).</li>
                                <li>To mark the record as a favorite, click the star icon to the left of the desired record's row.</li>
                                <li>To collapse or expand the subpanel, click the Up arrow to the left of the Plus button.</li>
                                <li>To change the column size in the subpanel, place your cursor on the column divider and when the Left and Right arrow appears, click and drag the column to the desired size. Please note that the column width will not be preserved when you navigate away from the page.</li>

                            <p>The Emails subpanel in the Accounts module displays both emails implicitly and explicitly related to the account record in addition to all emails from its related contact records. Emails in Sugar are implicitly related to records in Sugar that match an email address in the From, To, or Cc fields in the email. This implicit relationship is made for emails sent from Sugar as well as any email imported into Sugar via Inbound email accounts or email archiving. While composing an email or relating an existing email to a record, users have the ability to set an explicit relationship via the flex relate field by <a href="#e06b545-5f8a-348a-a1db-556e3f1b53ba_Relating_Emails">Relating Emails</a>. This allows the email to be explicitly related to a single record from one of many modules.</p>
                            <p><strong>Note</strong>: Administrators can enable or disable emails from related contacts from appearing in the Emails subpanel and History dashlet via Admin &gt; Related Contacts Emails. For more information regarding enabling and disabling related contacts emails, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/06_Email/#Related_Contacts_Emails">Related Contacts Emails</a> section of the Emails documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
                            <p>The Emails subpanel allows the following functions to be performed:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>To view the details of an email, click the subject in the subpanel to open it in detail view.</li>
                                <li>Minimize the subpanel by clicking "^" (up arrow).</li>

                                <li>Click "+" to create a new email that will have an implicit relationship with this record.</li>
                                <li>Sort the emails by Subject, Status, Date Created, Date Modified, or Assigned User.</li>
                                <li>Click "More emails" to see any additional emails hidden by the default view.</li>
                                <li>To change the column size in the subpanel, place your cursor on the column divider, and when the Left and Right arrow appears, click and drag the column to the desired size.

                            <p>The Campaign Log subpanel contains historical information regarding an account record's interaction with all Sugar campaigns. When a mass marketing campaign is sent to an account (or manually marked as sent in the case of non-email campaigns), the related campaign activity information will appear within the Campaign Log subpanel. This information mirrors the "View Status" page available from within each individual campaign and shows activities such as when a campaign was sent, when the recipient viewed the campaign message, when the recipient clicked a tracked link within the campaign, etc. Since this subpanel contains historical campaign interactions for the account, it cannot be used to associate an account with a campaign or otherwise manage a campaign or target list. For more information on associating an account with a campaign, please refer to the <a href="#c-35ef-c853-bcfd-551b22d5c5ac_Adding_Accounts_to_a_Target_List">Adding Accounts to a Target List</a> section of this documentation.

    <p>An intelligence pane displays to the right of the account's record view and provides users with valuable information specific to the account's sales, activities, etc. The Help Dashboard normally displays by default along with the Record View Help dashlet and Learning Resources dashlet. The Record View Help dashlet provides users with a brief introduction to the module along with some instructions to help users utilize and navigate around the record view. A link to the corresponding documentation (e.g. Accounts documentation) in the Application guide is also provided within the Help dashlet. The Learning Resources dashlet includes links to Sugar University, Community Forums, and Documentation &amp; Support, which provide access to additional resources. Simply click the appropriate link to be directed to the specific page in a separate tab. For more information regarding the Help dashboard, please refer to the <a href="#d03d1-d6ae-25ce-a8e4-551b225ee8d6_Viewing_Via_Record_View">Intelligence Pane</a> documentation. You can access the My Dashboard, which will display some stock dashlets (e.g. Planned Activities dashlet, History dashlet , etc.) by clicking the triangle to the right of "Help Dashboard" and selecting "My Dashboard". For example, the History dashlet displays calls and meetings that have taken place as well as related emails for the account record. By default, the Opportunity Metrics, Case Summary, News Feed, Planned Activities, and History dashlets are available in the stock dashboard called "My Dashboard". Users may choose to view any of their dashboards using the triangle to the right of the current dashboard's name and may create other dashboards for use with the Accounts module by clicking the Create button. Selecting "Edit" from the Actions menu on the upper right will allow them to make changes and add additional dashlets to their dashboards.</p>
    <p>Users can edit individual dashlets by clicking the Gear icon on the upper right of each dashlet. Dashlets may also be dragged and dropped to rearrange them within the current dashboard. You can collapse dashlets you do not wish to view by clicking the Up arrow on the upper right of the dashlet.

            <p>If an account record is invalid or should no longer appear in your organization's Sugar instance, it may be deleted from either the Accounts record view or list view. Deleting via the record view allows you to delete a single record while the list view allows for mass deleting multiple records at once as well as single record deletions. Deleting account records will not delete the related records and will only remove the relationship, so you may wish to also delete any related records to avoid orphaned records.</p>

            <p>Sugar's Export option allows users to download all fields for the selected accounts to their computers as a .CSV (comma-separated values) file. This may be useful when needing to use Account data with other software such as Microsoft Excel or to update existing records by exporting, making changes, then importing the altered accounts back into Sugar. For more information on updating existing records via import, please refer to the <a href="#f-87f1-f338-50da-551b227d034a_Importing_Updates_to_Existing_Records">Import</a> documentation. Due to PHP memory limitations on the server, there may be occasions when the application times out while exporting a large number of account records. If you encounter an error when performing this action, we recommend selecting the records in smaller batches.</p>
            <p>Accounts may be exported from the Accounts list view by selecting "Export" from the Actions menu. Users with access to the Reports module also have the option of creating or accessing reports containing specifically chosen fields for accounts and their related record(s). Please note that only Rows and Columns-type reports have the ability to be exported.

            <p>Between multiple users working in Sugar, importing new records, and converting leads, it is possible for duplicate account records to be accidentally input to the system. Before creating a new account record, a good practice is to first check that the account does not already exist in Sugar. You can locate duplicate records for cleanup using <a href="#c-35ef-c853-bcfd-551b22d5c5ac_Module_Search">module search</a> from the Accounts list view. Searching for accounts with similar names or other information can turn search into a powerful, duplicates-finding tool. Sugar also provides a wizard for finding potential duplicates that is available from the Accounts record view and may be used as shown below. If duplicate account records are detected, you can perform a merge per the <a href="#c-35ef-c853-bcfd-551b22d5c5ac_Merging_Accounts">Merging Accounts</a> section of this documentation.</p>
            <p>Please note that your ability to use the Find Duplicates action may be restricted by any role which prevents account deletion. For more information on roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide. Check with your system administrator if you do not see the Find Duplicates option.</p>
            <p>Use the following steps to locate duplicate accounts using the Find Duplicates option from the Accounts record view:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Navigate to an account's record view.</li>
                <li>Choose "Find Duplicates" from the Actions menu. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/33a21e8b-f617-7abf-451b-550286076898.png" alt="" width="459" height="159" /></li>
                <li>Potential duplicate account records will be listed on the Find Duplicates page. Select the duplicate record(s) you wish to merge then click "Merge Duplicates".
                    <ul>
                        <li>You can preview the duplicate record's details by clicking the Preview button to the far right of the records row.</li>
                        <li>You can search for specific records from the Accounts list view if you wish to check for more possible duplicates. For more information on performing a search, please refer to the <a href="#c-35ef-c853-bcfd-551b22d5c5ac_Module_Search">Module Search</a> section of this documentation.</li>
                        <li>You can also click the Column Selection icon above the Preview button to change the list of fields that display on the list view column headers.</li>
                    </ul><br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b9d759df-247e-b52b-ab27-550286ccd348.png" alt="" width="673" height="184" /></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Once you click "Merge Duplicates", the merging process with the current record will begin. For instructions on performing the merge that follows, please refer to Steps 3-9 of the <a href="#c-35ef-c853-bcfd-551b22d5c5ac_Merging_Via_List_View">Merging Via List View</a> section of this documentation.</p>

<h2 id="d9021f-8b07-8a2d-1d45-551b22c1d383_Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Sugar's Revenue Line Items module consists of individual line items of business which are included on an opportunity record and tracked through the sales lifecycle. In Sugar Enterprise and Ultimate, the opportunity record acts as a header for one or more revenue line item records. This allows for greater granularity when working opportunities and forecasting since each line item within an opportunity can have it's own sales stage and probability as well as being included or excluded from a user's forecasting worksheet individually.</p>
<p>Each revenue line item may be related to a product from your organization's Product Catalog. Doing so will cause the product's values to automatically populate matching fields on the revenue line item. For more information about the Product Catalog, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/08_Products_and_Quotes#Product_Catalog">Products and Quotes</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<p>There are various ways you can create revenue line items in Sugar such as via the Opportunities module, Revenue Line Items module, duplication, import, etc. This documentation will cover how to use the Revenue Line Items module as well as the various actions and options available from within the module.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If your instance is configured to use opportunities alone without revenue line items, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/04_Sugar_Professional/Sugar_Professional_7.6/Application_Guide/13_Opportunities">Opportunities</a> documentation in the Professional Edition Application Guide. For more information about changing your opportunities model via Admin &gt; Opportunities, please see the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/105_Opportunities">Opportunities Configuration</a> documentation in the Administration Guide.</p>
<h2 id="d9021f-8b07-8a2d-1d45-551b22c1d383_Revenue_Line_Item_Fields">Revenue Line Item Fields</h2>
<p>The Revenue Line Items module contains a number of stock fields which come out-of-the-box with Sugar. The below definitions are suggested meanings for the fields, but the fields can be leveraged differently to best meet your organization's needs. Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to alter, add, or remove fields via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on configuring fields, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Fields">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

<h3 id="d9021f-8b07-8a2d-1d45-551b22c1d383_Sales_Stages">Sales Stages</h3>
<p>A sales stage identifies the current stage (e.g. Prospecting, Qualification, etc.) that the revenue line item is in during the sales cycle. When you select a sales stage in the revenue line item record, the system automatically populates the corresponding probability value (e.g. 10, 20, etc.) in the Probability (%) field. These probability values are a useful tool as it helps calculate and predict your sales forecast for a specified time period. For more information on the Forecasts module, please refer to the <a href="#f50de1-d27b-b66e-afb0-551b220a0642_Forecasts">Forecasts</a> documentation. Administrators have the ability to configure the sales stage and probability values for each sales stage via Admin &gt; Dropdown Editor. For more information on configuring the sales stages and probability values, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools#Editing_Dropdown_Lists">Developer Tools</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

<h2 id="d9021f-8b07-8a2d-1d45-551b22c1d383_Searching_Revenue_Line_Items">Searching Revenue Line Items</h2>
<p>The Revenue Line Items list view includes a module search to help you locate records easily and effectively in a module-specific manner. Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Revenue Line Items list view below. Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Please note that Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %services). This will pull up any record that has the word "services" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p>
<p>For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Search">Search</a> documentation.</p>
<h3 id="d9021f-8b07-8a2d-1d45-551b22c1d383_Module_Search">Module Search</h3>
<p>Module search enables users to easily search by revenue line item name within the module and pull up matching records in the list view. The search also provides a Filter option which can be used in combination with the open Search box to narrow your search further using the available options as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Create</strong> : Create a new custom filter which you can use to filter your search
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Note</strong>: You can also click "Create" to the right of the Filter option.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>All Revenue Line Items</strong> : Returns all records in the module to which you have access</li>
    <li><strong>My Favorites</strong> : Returns only records you have marked as favorites</li>
    <li><strong>My Revenue Line Items</strong> : Returns only records assigned to you</li>
    <li><strong>Recently Created </strong>: Returns only records you created in the module within the last 7 days</li>
    <li><strong>Recently Viewed </strong>: Returns only records you have viewed in the module within the last 7 days</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/bde97823-2488-48d4-dc5b-550306676abf.png" alt="" width="486" height="243" /></p>
<p>When you choose a filter, Sugar will return revenue line items which match both the selected filter and any name provided in the "Search by revenue line item..." bar in the filtered list view results. For example, if you select "My Revenue Line Items" in the Filter options and enter a revenue line item name, Sugar will only return revenue line item records with a matching name that are assigned to you. Once the search is complete, the relevant results will populate in the <a href="#d9021f-8b07-8a2d-1d45-551b22c1d383_Revenue_Line_Items_List_View">list view</a> below the search bar. To see all revenue line item records to which you have access, simply select the All Revenue Line Items option in the filter and clear any text from the search bar. You can also click the Clear icon within the selected filter option (e.g. My Revenue Line Items) in the Search bar to clear the filter and pull up all list view search results. When you run a search using a saved or created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/ad9f6e7b-91b4-8d25-99d1-550306612b06.png" alt="" width="369" height="187" /></p>
<p>Please note that you will only be able to see revenue line item records as allowed by your team membership, user access type, and assigned roles. For more information on teams and roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/031_Team_Management">Team Management</a> and <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide.

<h4 id="d9021f-8b07-8a2d-1d45-551b22c1d383_Creating_a_Filter">Creating a Filter</h4>
<p>Users can also create new filters via the Create Filter option in the Filter list of the search bar. This allows users to add custom, complex filter options when searching in the Revenue Line Items list view. You have the option to add multiple fields to your new filter by clicking the Plus button to the right of the filter selection dropdown lists and set select operators along with their value(s). A filter's criteria need to be true for a record in order for it to appear in the list view search result. Additionally, filters with no specified values may be saved as a custom filter to act as a filter template when a user often searches using the same fields but with varying values. Please note that only fields you have view access for will appear in the Filter list when creating a search filter.</p>
<p>When you run a search using a created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away.</p>
<p>The following steps cover creating a new Sales Stage filter as an example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click the Filter option on the Revenue Line Items search bar then select "Create".

<p>Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Beginning with version 6.5.0, Full Text Search is used with Global Search to search throughout nearly all fields and modules for an enhanced search experience. The Global Search bar is located on the top right hand side of Sugar. You can click the magnifying glass icon or hit Return/Enter to perform your search once the text string is entered in the search box. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/45000f9c-5b11-a0be-854c-550302b230fa.png" alt="" width="285" height="38" /></p>
<p>To use global search, you need to first enter the keyword into the search box and the pop-up results will begin appearing once you enter in at least one character. Clicking the magnifying glass icon or hitting your Return/Enter key will cause Sugar to return exact matches for your keyword rather than matches with words beginning with your keyword. For more information on using and configuring Global Search, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Global_Search">Global Search</a> section of the Search documentation.</p>

<h3 id="d9021f-8b07-8a2d-1d45-551b22c1d383_Subpanels">Subpanels</h3>
<p>Beneath a revenue line item record's fields are subpanels containing related records from various modules. Selecting the Data View button will display the subpanels rather than the record's activity stream. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/bd6a2c9a-1d16-dfc5-25fe-55030610ded4.png" alt="" width="540" height="106" /></p>
<h4 id="d9021f-8b07-8a2d-1d45-551b22c1d383_Filter_Options">Filter Options</h4>
<p>While in Data View, all of the revenue line item record's related records will be displayed beneath the record's fields. Users have the ability to search for records which appear in the subpanels as well as filter the view to only display a specific module. To locate a record by name, enter the keyword into the Search bar, and the subpanel(s) with the matching record(s) will appear below. To filter, simply click the Related option to the far left of the Search bar and select the module whose subpanel you wish to view. Filter and search may be combined to only display matching records within a selected module. To see all subpanels to which you have access, simply select "All" in the Related options and remove any text from the search bar. When you run a search using a saved or created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the page. Returning to the page will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/9523a164-573f-9666-0130-550306fa9dae.png" alt="" height="190" width="542" /></p>
<p>When a Sidecar module (e.g. Notes) is selected from the Related options, you have the option to filter the related subpanels further using one of the available options (e.g. My Favorites, Recently Created, etc.). Please note that you can also create custom filters for related Sidecar modules. Once the related module (e.g. Notes) is selected, either click the Filter option and select "Create" or click "Create" to the right of the Filter option. For more information on creating a related records filter, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Creating_a_Related_Records_Filter">Creating a Related Records Filter</a> section of the Search documentation.</p>
<h4 id="d9021f-8b07-8a2d-1d45-551b22c1d383_Reordering_Subpanels">Reordering Subpanels</h4>
<p>Users can easily move subpanels to a new location on the record view by dragging and dropping the subpanel's header. The new subpanel order will remain for a user upon subsequent visits to the module until the user's browser cache is cleared. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/cbafe0dc-a1d3-06ed-571e-550304afa317.png" alt="Reordering_Subpanels" width="719" height="347" /></p>
<h4 id="d9021f-8b07-8a2d-1d45-551b22c1d383_Related_Record_Subpanels">Related Record Subpanels</h4>
<p>The only type of subpanel displayed out-of-the-box on a revenue line item record view is the revenue line item's related documents. For every relationship between two modules, the relationship type determines whether a related record will be displayed in the field listing or in a subpanel. Revenue line items may be related to multiple documents, so the Documents subpanel appears below the record's fields.</p>
<p>Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to change the fields (e.g. Name, Assigned User, etc.) and labels of each subpanel by configuring the layout via Admin &gt; Studio to provide visibility to the most important fields. For more information on modifying subpanels, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Editing_Subpanels">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<p>Related record subpanels allow the following operations to be performed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To view the details of a related record, click the record's name in the subpanel to open it in record view.</li>
    <li>To relate an existing record to the account, choose "Link Existing Record" from the subpanel's Action menu, then locate and select the desired record.</li>
    <li>To relate a new record to the account, click the Plus button to the left of the Actions menu, then complete the record view layout and click "Save".</li>
    <li>To delete the revenue line item's relationship to a record, click "Unlink". This removes the relationship, but does not delete the record itself.</li>
    <li>To mark the record as a favorite, click the star icon to the left of the desired record's row.</li>
    <li>To collapse or expand the subpanel, click the Up arrow to the left of the Plus button.</li>
    <li>To change the column size in the subpanel, place your cursor on the column divider and when the Left and Right arrow appears, click and drag the column to the desired size. Please note that the column width will not be preserved when you navigate away from the page.</li>

<h4 id="d9021f-8b07-8a2d-1d45-551b22c1d383_Emails_Subpanel">Emails Subpanel</h4>
<p>The Emails subpanel in the [Module Name] module displays both emails implicitly and explicitly related to the account record. Emails in Sugar are implicitly related to records in Sugar that match an email address in the From, To, or Cc fields in the email. This implicit relationship is made for emails sent from Sugar as well as any email imported into Sugar via Inbound email accounts or email archiving. While composing an email or relating an existing email to a record, users have the ability to set an explicit relationship via the flex relate field by Relating Emails. This allows the email to be explicitly related to a single record from one of many modules.</p>
<p>The Emails subpanel allows the following functions to be performed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To view the details of an email, click the subject in the subpanel to open it in detail view.</li>
    <li>Minimize the subpanel by clicking "^" (up arrow).</li>
    <li>Expand the subpanel by clicking "v" (down arrow).</li>
    <li>Click "+" to create a new email that will have an implicit relationship with this record.</li>
    <li>Sort the emails by Subject, Status, Date Created, Date Modified, or Assigned User.</li>
    <li>Click "More emails" to see any additional emails hidden by the default view.</li>
    <li>To change the column size in the subpanel, place your cursor on the column divider, and when the Left and Right arrow appears, click and drag the column to the desired size. For more information on resizing columns, please refer to the <a href="#d9021f-8b07-8a2d-1d45-551b22c1d383_Column_Resizing">Column Resizing</a> section of this documentation.

<p>An intelligence pane displays to the right of the revenue line item's record view and provides users with valuable information specific to the record's forecasting and other data. The Help Dashboard normally displays by default along with the Record View Help dashlet and Learning Resources dashlet. The Record View Help dashlet provides users with a brief introduction to the module along with some instructions to help users utilize and navigate around the record view. A link to the corresponding documentation (e.g. Revenue Line Items documentation) in the Application guide is also provided within the Help dashlet. The Learning Resources dashlet includes links to Sugar University, Community Forums, and Documentation &amp; Support, which provide access to additional resources. Simply click the appropriate link to be directed to the specific page in a separate tab. For more information regarding the Help dashboard, please refer to the <a href="#d03d1-d6ae-25ce-a8e4-551b225ee8d6_Viewing_Via_Record_View">Intelligence Pane</a> documentation. You can access the My Dashboard, which will display some stock dashlets (e.g. Planned Activities dashlet, History dashlet , etc.) by clicking the triangle to the right of "Help Dashboard" and selecting "My Dashboard". Users may choose to view any of their dashboards using the triangle to the right of the current dashboard's name and may create other dashboards for use with the Revenue Line Items module by clicking the Create button. Selecting "Edit" from the Actions menu on the upper right will allow them to make changes and add additional dashlets to their dashboards.</p>
<p>Users can edit individual dashlets by clicking the Gear icon on the upper right of each dashlet. Dashlets may also be dragged and dropped to rearrange them within the current dashboard.

<p>If a product record is invalid or should no longer appear in your organization's Sugar instance, it may be deleted as long as it's Status field is not set to "Closed Won" or "Closed Lost". For data integrity purposes, closed revenue line items may not be deleted. Deletion may be performed from either the Revenue Line Items detail view or list view. Deleting via the detail view allows you to delete a single record while the list view allows for mass deleting multiple records at once. Deleting revenue line item records will not delete the related records and will only remove the relationship, so you may wish to also delete any related records to avoid orphaned records.</p>

<p>Between multiple users working in Sugar, importing new records, and converting leads, it is possible for duplicate revenue line item records to be accidentally input to the system. Before creating a new revenue line item record, a good practice is to first check that the revenue line item does not already exist in Sugar. You can locate duplicate records for cleanup using <a href="#d9021f-8b07-8a2d-1d45-551b22c1d383_Module_Search">module search</a> from the Revenue Line Items list view. Searching for revenue line items with similar names or other information can turn search into a powerful, duplicates-finding tool. Sugar also provides a wizard for finding potential duplicates that is available from the Revenue Line Items record view and may be used as shown below. If duplicate revenue line item records are detected, you can perform a merge per the <a href="#d9021f-8b07-8a2d-1d45-551b22c1d383_Merging_Revenue_Line_Items">Merging Revenue Line Items</a> section of this documentation.</p>

Check with your system administrator if you do not see the Find Duplicates option.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to locate duplicate revenue line items using the Find Duplicates option from the Revenue Line Items record view:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to a revenue line item's record view.</li>
    <li>Choose "Find Duplicates" from the Actions menu. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e6f1df56-b5e7-dbc4-e14a-550306fdb73c.png" alt="" width="450" height="196" /></li>
    <li>Potential duplicate revenue line item records will be listed on the Find Duplicates page. Select the duplicate record(s) you wish to merge then click "Merge Duplicates".
        <ul>
            <li>You can preview the duplicate record's details by clicking the Preview button to the far right of the records row.</li>
            <li>You can search for specific records from the Revenue Line Items list view if you wish to check for more possible duplicates. For more information on performing a search, please refer to the <a href="#d9021f-8b07-8a2d-1d45-551b22c1d383_Module_Search">Module Search</a> section of this documentation.</li>

</ol>
<h2 id="d9021f-8b07-8a2d-1d45-551b22c1d383_Updating_Currency_Rates">Updating Currency Rates</h2>
<p>When saving a revenue line item in a currency that differs from the system-defined default currency, Sugar will store the conversion rate for that currency at the record level. This conversion rate is used to calculate the converted amounts when the field is set to use the system default currency (as opposed to the user's preferred currency which is explained below). To keep amounts historically accurate, the conversion rate will only update on a revenue line item provided the sales stage is not set to "Closed Won" or "Closed Lost". If the line item is in any other sales stage, the conversion rate will update under the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The revenue line item undergoes a save event (e.g. mass update, manual save, etc.) and the record's currency has a different conversion rate defined in Admin &gt; Currencies than is currently saved in the opportunity.</li>
    <li>An administrator updates the currency exchange rate under Admin &gt; Currencies. This will trigger a scheduled job which updates all revenue line items saved with that currency to the new rate.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the viewing user's profile has the Show Preferred Currency option selected, the converted amounts display in the user's preferred currency. In this case, the conversion rate used to calculate the converted amounts is drawn directly from the conversion rate at the system level rather than any conversion rate stored on the record. This means that the value will always use the current conversion rate regardless of the line item's sales stage. For this reason, the converted amount fields should not be considered historically accurate for closed revenue line items when it is using the user's preferred currency. For information about setting a user's Preferred Currency and Show Preferred Currency options, please refer to the <a href="#e-543f-551b22c2c01c_Locale_Settings">User Profile</a> documentation.</p>
<p>For more information about currency exchange rates, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/05_System#Currencies">Currencies</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

<h2 id="b900bc-4f66-6902-7a65-551b2200c140_Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Sugar's Opportunities module allows you to track individual sales and the line items belonging to those sales from start to finish. Each opportunity record represents a header for a group of revenue line items as well as relating to other important records such as quotes, contacts, etc. Each revenue line item is the prospective sale of a particular product and includes relevant sale data. Each revenue line item will typically progress through several Sales Stages until it is marked either "Closed Won" or "Closed Lost". The Opportunity record reflects the amount and expected close date of its revenue line items. Opportunities and revenue line items can be leveraged even further by using Sugar's Forecasting module to understand and predict sales trends as well as focus work to achieve sales quotas. For more information on the Forecasts module, please refer to the <a href="#f50de1-d27b-b66e-afb0-551b220a0642_Forecasts">Forecasts</a> documentation.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If your instance is configured to use opportunities alone without revenue line items, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/04_Sugar_Professional/Sugar_Professional_7.6/Application_Guide/13_Opportunities">Opportunities</a> documentation in the Professional Edition Application Guide.

<h2 id="b900bc-4f66-6902-7a65-551b2200c140_Opportunity_Fields">Opportunity Fields</h2>
<p>The Opportunities module contains a number of stock fields which come out-of-the-box with Sugar. The below definitions are suggested meanings for the fields, but the fields can be leveraged differently to best meet your organization's needs. Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to alter, add, or remove fields via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on configuring fields, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Fields">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

<h2 id="b900bc-4f66-6902-7a65-551b2200c140_Creating_Opportunities">Creating Opportunities</h2>
<p>There are various methods for creating opportunities in Sugar including via the Opportunities module, quick create, duplication, and import. The same record view layout opens when creating the opportunity directly from the Opportunities menu as well as via the Quick Create menu and includes all of the relevant fields for your organization. Please note that administrators can configure the Record View layout via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on configuring layouts, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Layouts">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<p>Each opportunity must have at least one related revenue line item record. After your opportunity has been created, you will be prompted to create one or more revenue line items for that opportunity. For more information about creating revenue line items, please refer to the <a href="#d9021f-8b07-8a2d-1d45-551b22c1d383_Creating_Revenue_Line_Items">Revenue Line Items</a> documentation.</p>
<h3 id="b900bc-4f66-6902-7a65-551b2200c140_Creating_Via_Opportunities_Module">Creating Via Opportunities Module</h3>
<p>One of the most common methods of opportunity creation is via the Opportunities module using the Create Opportunity option in the module tab or the Create button on the list view. This opens up the record view layout which allows you to enter all of the relevant information for the opportunity. Beneath the opportunity, a subpanel appears where you can create one or more revenue line items that make up the opportunity. This allows both the opportunity and revenue line item(s) to be created simultaneously.<br />The following steps cover creating an opportunity and revenue line item via the Opportunities module as an example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click the triangle in the Opportunities module tab to open the actions menu and select "Create Opportunity". You can also click the Create button on the upper right of the Opportunities list view.<br />From Opportunities module tab:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/abc80bef-2ef7-a9f1-6ecb-550305286854.png" alt="" height="104" width="245" /><br />From Opportunities list view:<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5bacbcc2-d492-f055-229a-5503095eca9e.png" alt="" width="456" height="112" /></li>
    <li>Enter appropriate values for the <a href="#b900bc-4f66-6902-7a65-551b2200c140_Opportunity_Fields">fields</a> in the record view layout. All required fields will indicate "Required" in the field and must be completed prior to saving.</li>
    <li>Go down to the Revenue Line Items create subpanel in the Opportunities record view and enter appropriate values (e.g. Revenue Line Item name, expected close date, etc.) for the fields in the subpanel.
        <ul>
            <li>Scroll left-to-right using the horizontal scroll bar on the bottom of the subpanel to view all available fields.</li>
            <li><strong>Note</strong>: The opportunity record must have at least one related revenue line item in order to save.</li>
        </ul><br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/9f970b16-a5ba-aec2-bf01-550309b0d361.png" alt="" width="673" height="335" /></li>
    <li>To add additional revenue line items to the opportunity, click the Plus button to the far right of the subpanel row.
        <ul>
            <li>The current Revenue Line Item row is validated when adding a new row to ensure that all required fields and data are entered properly.</li>
            <li>To remove any revenue line items from the opportunity, simply click the Minus button to the left of the Plus button. Please note that you cannot remove the first revenue line item as at least one related revenue line item is required for the opportunity to save.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Once all the necessary information is entered, click "Save".
        <ul>
            <li>Alternatively, you can use the Actions Menu to the right of the Save button to select "Save and view" or "Save and create new". "Save and view" will display the record's details after the save is complete. "Save and create new" saves the current record and opens a new, blank record view in edit mode where you can create another record.</li>
            <li>The created revenue line item(s) will appear in the Revenue Line Items subpanel beneath the opportunity record's fields in the record view.</li>

<p>As you interact with your client and present the quote for your products and services, you can easily create an opportunity from the Quotes detail view to better track your sales. The displayed Opportunity record view is pre-populated with the original quote's values to reflect the opportunity name, account name, expected close date, best, likely, and worst amounts. Any other fields populated will be based off the default values as they are defined in Studio for the Opportunities module. Please note that the opportunity record will automatically be associated to the quote. Also, each quoted line item of the quote will become a revenue line item associated to the newly created opportunity record. By default, the sales stage is set to "Proposal/Price Quote", the probability is "65%", the type is "New Business", and the lead source is "Self Generated". You can edit the revenue line item record accordingly if you wish to change the default values for sales stage, type, and lead source.

<p>The Opportunities list view includes a module search to help you locate records easily and effectively in a module-specific manner. Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Opportunities list view below. Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Please note that Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %services). This will pull up any record that has the word "services" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p>
<p>For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Search">Search</a> documentation.</p>
<h3 id="b900bc-4f66-6902-7a65-551b2200c140_Module_Search">Module Search</h3>
<p>Module search enables users to easily search by opportunity name within the Opportunities module and pull up matching records in the list view. The search also provides a Filter option which can be used in combination with the open Search box to narrow your search further using the available options as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Create</strong> : Create a new custom filter which you can use to filter your search
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Note</strong>: You can also click "Create" to the right of the Filter option.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>All Opportunities</strong> : Returns all records in the module to which you have access</li>
    <li><strong>My Favorites</strong> : Returns only records you have marked as favorites</li>
    <li><strong>My Opportunities</strong> : Returns only records assigned to you</li>
    <li><strong>Recently Created </strong>: Returns only records you created in the module within the last 7 days</li>
    <li><strong>Recently Viewed </strong>: Returns only records you have viewed in the module within the last 7 days</li>
</ul>

<p>When you choose a filter, Sugar will return opportunities which match both the selected filter and any name provided in the "Search by opportunity name..." bar in the filtered list view results. For example, if you select "My Opportunities" in the Filter options and enter an opportunity name, Sugar will only return opportunity records with a matching name that are assigned to you. Once the search is complete, the relevant results will populate in the <a href="#b900bc-4f66-6902-7a65-551b2200c140_Opportunities_List_View">list view</a> below the search bar. To see all opportunity records to which you have access, simply select the All Opportunities option in the filter and remove any text from the search bar. You can also click the Clear icon within the selected filter option (e.g. My Opportunities) in the Search bar to clear the filter and pull up all list view search results. When you run a search using a saved or created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8f8a3ab5-0ef5-0520-5446-5503058e5295.png" alt="" width="376" height="159" /></p>
<p>Please note that you will only be able to see opportunity records as allowed by your team membership, user access type, and assigned roles. For more information on teams and roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/031_Team_Management">Team Management</a> and <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide. Administrators can configure what fields appear on the Opportunities Module Search via Admin &gt; Studio.

<h4 id="b900bc-4f66-6902-7a65-551b2200c140_Creating_a_Filter">Creating a Filter</h4>
<p>Users can also create new filters via the Create option in the Filter list of the search bar. This allows users to add custom, complex filter options when searching in the Opportunities list view. You have the option to add multiple fields to your new filter by clicking the Plus button to the right of the filter selection dropdown lists and set select operators along with their value(s). A filter's criteria need to be true for a record in order for it to appear in the list view search result. Additionally, filters with no specified values may be saved as a custom filter to act as a filter template when a user often searches using the same fields but with varying values. Please note that only fields you have view access for will appear in the Filter list when creating a search filter.</p>
<p>When you run a search using a created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away.</p>
<p>The following steps cover creating a new Sales Stage filter as an example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click the Filter option on the Opportunities search bar then select "Create".
        <ul>
            <li>You can also click "Create" to the right of the Filter option.</li>

    <li>Select the field you wish to add to your filter as well as the condition and matching criteria.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Note</strong>: Only fields you have view access for will be available to add in the Filter list.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>To add additional fields to the new filter, click the Plus button to the right of the filter.
        <ul>
            <li>To remove fields from the new filter, click the Minus button to the right of the filter.</li>
            <li>To clear any filter values (e.g. Qualification), simply click the "x" next to the value or select "Reset" to the left of the Save button.</li>
        </ul><br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/900eb3c1-d4e2-09ec-707d-550305d918ef.png" alt="" height="191" width="495" /></li>
</ol>
<p>The list view will automatically display results matching your filters as you create and modify the criteria.</p>
<h4 id="b900bc-4f66-6902-7a65-551b2200c140_Saving_a_Filter">Saving a Filter</h4>
<p>Saving a filter will preserve the chosen fields as well as the condition(s) of the matching value(s). Additionally, it will allow users to easily select previously created and saved filters from the Filter options.</p>
<p>The following steps cover saving a new search by Name filter as an example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Create a <a href="#b900bc-4f66-6902-7a65-551b2200c140_Creating_a_Filter">new filter</a> to perform a search on your desired fields.</li>
    <li>Enter in a name for the new filter (e.g. "Qualification Sales Stage").<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/4acb6dc6-127d-50f6-7bf9-55030590de90.png" alt="" width="494" height="74" /></li>
    <li>Click "Save" to add this filter to the module's Filter options.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="b900bc-4f66-6902-7a65-551b2200c140_Global_Search">Global Search</h3>
<p>Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Beginning with version 6.5.0, Full Text Search is used with Global Search to search throughout nearly all fields and modules for an enhanced search experience. The Global Search bar is located on the top right hand side of Sugar. You can click the magnifying glass icon or hit Return/Enter to perform your search once the text string is entered in the search box.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/2e673652-200a-5bdc-28ce-550305a9b578.png" alt="" width="381" height="52" /></p>
<p>To use global search, you need to first enter the keyword into the search box and the pop-up results will begin appearing once you enter in at least one character. Clicking the magnifying glass icon or hitting your Return/Enter key will cause Sugar to return exact matches for your keyword rather than matches with words beginning with your keyword. For more information on using and configuring Global Search, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Global_Search">Global Search</a> section of the Search documentation.</p>
<p>Regular Sugar users can configure some aspects of global search such as what modules are displayed in the search results by clicking the down arrow within the search box then selecting the module(s) to include in the search. For more information on configuring your Global Search, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Advanced_Options">Search</a> documentation. Administrators can control additional elements of global search via Admin &gt; Search and Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on administrator configuration of Global Search, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Field_Options">Field Options</a> section of the Studio documentation as well as the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/05_System#Search">Search</a> section of the System documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

<h3 id="b900bc-4f66-6902-7a65-551b2200c140_Subpanels">Subpanels</h3>
<p>Beneath an opportunity record's fields are subpanels containing related records from various modules. Selecting the Data View button will display the subpanels rather than the record's activity stream.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/db5607dd-920f-ed0f-3319-550305901a17.png" alt="" height="158" width="606" /></p>
<h4 id="b900bc-4f66-6902-7a65-551b2200c140_Filter_Options">Filter Options</h4>
<p>While in Data View, all of the opportunity record's related records will be displayed beneath the opportunity record's fields. Users have the ability to search for records which appear in the subpanels as well as filter the view to only display a specific module (e.g. Leads, Contacts, etc.). To locate a record by name, enter the keyword into the Search bar, and the subpanel(s) with the matching record(s) will appear below. To filter, simply click the Related option to the far left of the Search bar and select the module whose subpanel you wish to view. Filter and search may be combined to only display matching records within a selected module. To see all subpanels to which you have access, simply select "All" in the Related options and remove any text from the search bar. When you run a search using a saved or created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the page. Returning to the page will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/46d817ea-8ed0-5413-94e6-55030585da9d.png" alt="" height="149" width="518" /></p>
<p>When a Sidecar module (e.g. Contacts, Leads, Tasks, etc.) is selected from the Related options, you have the option to filter the related subpanels further using one of the available options (e.g. My Favorites, Recently Created, etc.). Please note that you can also create custom filters for related Sidecar modules. Once the related module (e.g. Contacts) is selected, either click the Filter option and select "Create" or click "Create" to the right of the Filter option. For more information on creating a related records filter, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Creating_a_Related_Records_Filter">Creating a Related Records Filter</a> section of the Search documentation.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/955de2de-1b8c-3bc7-ac33-550305c154c0.png" alt="" height="221" width="421" /></p>
<h4 id="b900bc-4f66-6902-7a65-551b2200c140_Reordering_Subpanels">Reordering Subpanels</h4>
<p>Users can easily move subpanels to a new location on the record view by dragging and dropping the subpanel's header. The new subpanel order will remain for a user upon subsequent visits to the module until the user's browser cache is cleared.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/cbafe0dc-a1d3-06ed-571e-550304afa317.png" alt="Reordering_Subpanels" width="720" height="348" /></p>
<h4 id="b900bc-4f66-6902-7a65-551b2200c140_Related_Record_Subpanels">Related Record Subpanels</h4>
<p>The most common type of subpanels displayed on an opportunities record view contain the opportunity's related records belonging to various modules. The relationship type determines whether a related record will be displayed in the field listing or in a subpanel. For example, an opportunity may be related to only one account but related to multiple contacts. This means that the related account will be displayed amongst the opportunity's fields while contacts will be displayed in a subpanel beneath the fields.</p>
<p>Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to change the fields (e.g. Name, Assigned User, etc.) and labels of each subpanel by configuring the layout via Admin &gt; Studio to provide visibility to the most important fields. For more information on modifying subpanels, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Editing_Subpanels">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<p>Related record subpanels allow the following operations to be performed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To view the details of a related record, click the record's name in the subpanel to open it in record view.</li>
    <li>To relate an existing record to the opportunity, choose "Link Existing Record" from the subpanel's Action menu, then locate and select the desired record. Please note that the Link Existing Record option is not available when the relationship is required in the related module (e.g. Revenue Line Items).</li>
    <li>To relate a new record to the opportunity, click the Plus button to the left of the Actions menu, then complete the record view layout and click "Save".</li>
    <li>To inline edit the record directly from the subpanel, choose "Edit" from the Actions menu on the far right of the record's row and click "Save" to preserve the change.</li>
    <li>To delete the opportunity's relationship to a record, choose "Unlink" from the Actions menu on the far right of the record's row. This removes the relationship, but does not delete the record itself. Please note that the Unlink option is not available when the relationship is required in the related module (e.g. Revenue Line Items).</li>
    <li>To mark the record as a favorite, click the star icon to the left of the desired record's row.</li>
    <li>To collapse or expand the subpanel, click the arrow to the left of the Plus button.</li>
    <li>To change the column size in the subpanel, place your cursor on the column divider and when the Left and Right arrow appears, click and drag the column to the desired size. Please note that the column width will not be preserved when you navigate away from the page.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="b900bc-4f66-6902-7a65-551b2200c140_Emails_Subpanel">Emails Subpanel</h4>
<p>The Emails subpanel in the Opportunities module displays both emails implicitly and explicitly related to the opportunity record in addition to emails from its related contact records. Emails in Sugar are implicitly related to records in Sugar that match an email address in the From, To, or Cc fields in the email. This implicit relationship is made for emails sent from Sugar as well as any email imported into Sugar via Inbound email accounts or email archiving. While composing an email or relating an existing email to a record, users have the ability to set an explicit relationship via the flex relate field by <a href="#e06b545-5f8a-348a-a1db-556e3f1b53ba_Relating_Emails">Relating Emails</a>. This allows the email to be explicitly related to a single record from one of many modules.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Administrators can enable or disable emails from related contacts from appearing in the Emails subpanel and History dashlet via Admin &gt; Related Contacts Emails. For more information regarding enabling and disabling related contacts emails, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/06_Email/#Related_Contacts_Emails">Related Contacts Emails</a> section of the Emails documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<p>The Emails subpanel allows the following functions to be performed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To view the details of an email, click the subject in the subpanel to open it in detail view.</li>
    <li>Minimize the subpanel by clicking "^" (up arrow).</li>
    <li>Expand the subpanel by clicking "v" (down arrow).</li>
    <li>Click "+" to create a new email that will have an implicit relationship with this record.</li>
    <li>Sort the emails by Subject, Status, Date Created, Date Modified, or Assigned User.</li>
    <li>Click "More emails" to see any additional emails hidden by the default view.</li>
    <li>To change the column size in the subpanel, place your cursor on the column divider, and when the Left and Right arrow appears, click and drag the column to the desired size. For more information on resizing columns, please refer to the <a href="#b900bc-4f66-6902-7a65-551b2200c140_Column_Resizing">Column Resizing</a> section of this documentation.

<h4 id="b900bc-4f66-6902-7a65-551b2200c140_Revenue_Line_Items_Subpanel">Revenue Line Items Subpanel</h4>
<p>The Revenue Line Items subpanel contains all line items which make up this opportunity. Every opportunity must have one or more related revenue line items. Please note that the related revenue line item(s) in the subpanel determine the value for certain Opportunity fields (e.g. Status, Expected Close Date, etc.). The opportunity's Status field will be "New" until a revenue line item is added. It will then remain "In Progress" until all of the related revenue line items are closed. If any of the line items are "Closed Won" once all line items have been closed, then the parent opportunity will also be marked "Closed Won". If all related revenue line items are "Closed Lost", then the opportunity will also be marked "Closed Lost". The opportunity's Expected Close Date field will automatically reflect the latest close date of all of its related revenue line items. Throughout the opportunity's life cycle, the opportunity's amount fields (Likely, Best, Worst) will be automatically populated as the total of the corresponding fields on its related revenue line items.</p>
<p>A quote can also be generated from one or more of an opportunity's revenue line items from this subpanel. For more information, please refer to the <a href="#b900bc-4f66-6902-7a65-551b2200c140_Generating_a_Quote">Generating a Quote</a> section of this documentation.</p>
<h4 id="b900bc-4f66-6902-7a65-551b2200c140_Contacts_Subpanel">Contacts Subpanel</h4>
<p>The Contacts subpanel for opportunities allows users to select a role (e.g. Primary Decision Maker, Business Evaluator, etc.) for each related contact to help you classify how each individual will ultimately factor into the buying decision. To select a role, simply choose "Edit" from the Actions menu on the far right of the record's row in the subpanel. The record's row will open up within the subpanel allowing you to edit the individual fields. Select the appropriate role for the contact then click "Save" and the chosen role will display in the Contacts subpanel of the opportunity record.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/c9953434-b46b-9316-2a69-550305bc1df2.png" alt="" width="672" height="164" /></p>

<p>The Opportunity record view's activity stream displays user posts and record posts specific to the individual opportunity record. To view the record's activity stream, simply click the Activity Stream button below the opportunity's fields. Please note that posts added via the record view activity stream are only viewable within that record view unless a user is following the record.

<p>An intelligence pane displays to the right of the opportunity's record view and provides users with valuable information specific to the opportunity's sales, activities, etc. The Help Dashboard normally displays by default along with the Record View Help dashlet and Learning Resources dashlet. The Record View Help dashlet provides users with a brief introduction to the module along with some instructions to help users utilize and navigate around the record view. A link to the corresponding documentation (e.g. Opportunities documentation) in the Application guide is also provided within the Help dashlet. The Learning Resources dashlet includes links to Sugar University, Community Forums, and Documentation &amp; Support, which provide access to additional resources. Simply click the appropriate link to be directed to the specific page in a separate tab. For more information regarding the Help dashboard, please refer to the <a href="#d03d1-d6ae-25ce-a8e4-551b225ee8d6_Viewing_Via_Record_View">Intelligence Pane</a> documentation.

<h2 id="b900bc-4f66-6902-7a65-551b2200c140_Deleting_Opportunities">Deleting Opportunities</h2>
<p>If an opportunity record is invalid or should no longer appear in your organization's Sugar instance, it may be deleted from either the Opportunities record view or list view. Deleting via the record view allows you to delete a single record while the list view allows for mass deleting multiple records at once as well as single record deletions. Deleting opportunity records will not delete the related records and will only remove the relationship, so you may wish to also delete any related records to avoid orphaned records.</p>
<p>Please note for data integrity purposes, an opportunity related to a revenue line item with a "Closed Won" or "Closed Lost" status may not be deleted. In addition, revenue line items in these statuses may not be deleted.</p>
<p>Please note that your ability to delete opportunities may be restricted by a role. For more information on roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide.

<h2 id="b900bc-4f66-6902-7a65-551b2200c140_Exporting_Opportunities">Exporting Opportunities</h2>
<p>Sugar's Export option allows users to download all fields for the selected opportunities to their computers as a .CSV (comma-separated values) file. This may be useful when needing to use Opportunity data with other software such as Microsoft Excel or to update existing records by exporting, making changes, then importing the altered opportunities back into Sugar. For more information on updating existing records via import, please refer to the <a href="#f-87f1-f338-50da-551b227d034a_Importing_Updates_to_Existing_Records">Import</a> documentation. Due to PHP memory limitations on the server, there may be occasions when the application times out while exporting a large number of opportunity records. If you encounter an error when performing this action, we recommend selecting the records in smaller batches.</p>
<p>Opportunities may be exported from the Opportunities list view by selecting "Export" from the Actions menu. Users with access to the Reports module also have the option of creating or accessing reports containing specifically chosen fields for opportunities and their related record(s). Please note that only Rows and Columns-type reports have the ability to be exported. For more information on exporting records in Sugar, please refer to the <a href="#e6004c-15af-3450-3b7e-551b22bbe5d2_Exporting_From_Module_List_Views">Export</a> documentation.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/271a8425-5c1c-dfa7-44d9-55030551dcee.png" alt="" height="236" width="242" /></p>

<h2 id="b900bc-4f66-6902-7a65-551b2200c140_Finding_Duplicate_Opportunities">Finding Duplicate Opportunities</h2>
<p>Between multiple users working in Sugar, importing new records, and converting leads, it is possible for duplicate opportunity records to be accidentally input to the system. Before creating a new opportunity record, a good practice is to first check that the opportunity does not already exist in Sugar. You can locate duplicate records for cleanup using <a href="#b900bc-4f66-6902-7a65-551b2200c140_Module_Search">module search</a> from the Opportunities list view. Searching for opportunities with similar names or other information can turn search into a powerful, duplicates-finding tool. Sugar also provides a wizard for finding potential duplicates that is available from the Opportunities record view and may be used as shown below. If duplicate opportunity records are detected, you can perform a merge per the <a href="#b900bc-4f66-6902-7a65-551b2200c140_Merging_Opportunities">Merging Opportunities</a> section of this documentation.</p>
<p>Please note that your ability to use the Find Duplicates action may be restricted by any role which prevents opportunity deletion. For more information on roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide. Check with your system administrator if you do not see the Find Duplicates option.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to locate duplicate opportunities using the Find Duplicates option from the Opportunities record view:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to an opportunity 's record view.</li>
    <li>Choose "Find Duplicates" from the Actions menu.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/890d9554-a90d-2969-5bd8-55030504d618.png" alt="" width="475" height="168" /></li>
    <li>Potential duplicate opportunity records will be listed on the Find Duplicates page. Select the duplicate record(s) you wish to merge then click "Merge Duplicates".
        <ul>
            <li>You can preview the duplicate record's details by clicking the Preview button to the far right of the records row.</li>
            <li>You can search for specific records from the Opportunities list view if you wish to check for more possible duplicates. For more information on performing a search, please refer to the <a href="#b900bc-4f66-6902-7a65-551b2200c140_Module_Search">Module Search</a> section of this documentation.</li>
            <li>You can also click the Column Selection icon above the Preview button to change the list of fields that display on the list view column headers.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/cc20de8c-3abb-0762-b78e-550305bb2442.png" alt="" width="675" height="156" /></p>
<p>Once you click "Merge Duplicates", the merging process with the current record will begin. For instructions on performing the merge that follows, please refer to Steps 3-9 of the <a href="#b900bc-4f66-6902-7a65-551b2200c140_Merging_Via_List_View">Merging Via List View</a> section of this documentation.</p>
<h2 id="b900bc-4f66-6902-7a65-551b2200c140_Merging_Opportunities">Merging Opportunities</h2>
<p>When duplicate records are identified in Sugar, you have the option to merge two or more opportunities into a single record. Once the merge is complete, the duplicate opportunity record(s) will be deleted, and the primary record will remain. Please note that all relationships belonging to the duplicate opportunities will be merged to the primary record meaning that any calls, meetings, contacts, etc. related to the duplicate opportunity record(s) will automatically be related to the resulting, merged opportunity record.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Date Created, Date Modified, and Password field types are not supported when merging duplicate records in Sugar.</p>

<h3 id="b900bc-4f66-6902-7a65-551b2200c140_Merging_Via_List_View">Merging Via List View</h3>
<p><a href="#b900bc-4f66-6902-7a65-551b2200c140_Module_Search">Module Search</a> may be used to identify duplicate opportunities by, for example, searching for opportunities with similar names. Once your search has identified duplicate opportunities, you can merge them directly from the Opportunities list view.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to merge opportunities via the list view:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Use the list view's <a href="#b900bc-4f66-6902-7a65-551b2200c140_Module_Search">Module Search</a> to identify duplicate opportunities.</li>
    <li>Possible duplicates will be displayed in the list view. Select the duplicate record(s) that you wish to merge.
        <ul>
            <li>Please note that up to five records may be merged at once in Sugar. An error message ("Invalid number of records passed. The valid range is from 2 to 5 records.") will appear if more than five records are selected when attempting to perform a merge.</li>
        </ul><br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8b4b0354-89a0-5fb9-4b93-550305db512e.png" alt="" width="450" height="214" /></li>
    <li>Select "Merge" from the Actions menu to display the Merging Records page. The primary record's field values are displayed on the left while other record's values are in columns to the right. For convenience, fields with differing values will appear on the top of the list. Saving the merge will preserve only the field values marked with the radio button into a single record.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/9255aae8-b417-b8c1-cdbd-550305307997.png" alt="" width="650" height="234" />
        <p>If three or more records are selected to be merged, an X icon will appear at the top right of each record. Clicking the "X" will remove the record from the merge process but will not delete the record.</p>
    </li>
    <li>To change which record is considered the primary, drag and drop the Primary label on the top of a different column.</li>
    <li>Review the field values in each column and click the radio button to the left of the value that should appear on the final record. You can also manually type or select a new value for any field as necessary.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Note</strong>: Fields you do not have Edit access for cannot be edited on the merging records page.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Preview what the final, merged record will contain as you work by clicking the eye icon to display the preview in the Intelligence Pane.</li>
    <li>Click "Save" once all fields you wish to appear on the single, merged record have their radio buttons selected.</li>
    <li>A pop-up message will display confirming that the duplicate record(s) should be deleted. Click "Confirm" to proceed.</li>

<p>Sugar's Forecasts module incorporates revenue line item records to build forecasting worksheets and predict sales. Users can work towards sales quotas at the individual, team, and sales organization level.</p>
<p>Before users can access the Forecasts module to begin building forecasting worksheets, a user with administrator access must configure the Forecasts module with the organization's desired Time Periods, Ranges, and Scenarios. For more information on setting up the Forecasts module, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/10_Forecast">Forecast Configuration</a> documentation in the Administration Guide.</p>
<p>Sales representatives use the Forecasts module to work with their assigned revenue line items as the current time period progresses. These users will commit total predictions for their personal sales based on the revenue line items they expect to close. For instructions specific to a sales representative's use of the module, please refer to the <a href="#f50de1-d27b-b66e-afb0-551b220a0642_Sales_Representatives">Sales Representative</a> section of this documentation.</p>
<p>Sales managers work with their own revenue line item records similarly to other sales representatives. In addition, they aggregate their reportee's committed forecast amounts to predict their total team's sales and work towards the team's quota for each time period. For instructions specific to a sales manager's use of the module, please refer to the <a href="#f50de1-d27b-b66e-afb0-551b220a0642_Sales_Managers">Sales Managers</a> section of this documentation.</p>
<p>Additional insights are offered by the elements of the expandable Intelligence Pane including analysis for an individual's worksheet and analysis for a manager's team worksheets. For more information, please refer to the <a href="#f50de1-d27b-b66e-afb0-551b220a0642_be2bb599-03b2-2d5d-7650-55b99f713825_Intelligence_Pane">sales representative Intelligence Pane</a> and the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/14_Forecasts/index.html#Intelligence_Pane_2">sales manager Intelligence Pane</a> sections of this documentation.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If your instance is configured to use opportunities alone without revenue line items, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/04_Sugar_Professional/Sugar_Professional_7.6/Application_Guide/14_Forecasts">Forecasts</a> documentation in the Professional Edition Application Guide.

Select a past or future time period to work with revenue line items and forecast for those periods.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/61554840-f071-22ed-2f9a-550305b4659d.png" alt="" width="228" height="158" /></p>
<h3 id="f50de1-d27b-b66e-afb0-551b220a0642_Summary_and_Commit_History">Summary and Commit History</h3>
<p>To the right below the Time Period selection, you will see a summary of your current forecasting numbers for the time period currently in view. The large numbers are your current worksheet's Quota, Likely, Best, and Worst predictions. The smaller numbers show your most recent commit's Likely, Best, and Worst predictions. Any red or green arrows next to the large numbers show whether you worksheet's current (uncommitted) numbers are higher or lower than your most recent commit. Please note that you may or may not see a Best and Worst depending on your administrator's <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/10_Forecast#Scenarios">Scenarios</a> configuration. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/27fc700e-a195-b5f2-4e08-55030533f265.png" alt="" width="572" height="212" /></p>
<p>To the left of these summary numbers, you will see the date and time of your most recent commit. There will be no date and time shown if you have not yet committed for this time period. By clicking the arrow to the right of the latest commit date, a dark grey panel will appear showing a history of your commits for this time period along with the changes for each forecasting number from the previous commit.</p>
<h3 id="f50de1-d27b-b66e-afb0-551b220a0642_Filters">Filters</h3>
<p>Below the summary and commit history, you will see a filter bar which controls what kinds of revenue line items are displayed. By default, the "Include" filter will be active, meaning that only the revenue line items with a probability falling within the Include range specified during the administrator's <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/10_Forecast#Ranges">Ranges</a> configuration will be displayed. To add additional filters, click within the Filters bar and choose additional ranges. The filter(s) (e.g. Include, Exclude) added to the Filters bar will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the Forecasts module will automatically display the revenue line items based on the filter(s) you last applied.</p>
<p>Please note the Upside and custom ranges may or may not be available depending on the administrator's <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/10_Forecast#Ranges">Ranges</a> configuration. To remove ranges from the filter, click the "x" for each filter name. Removing all filters will display all of your assigned revenue line items. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d74e8f88-63fb-ec19-77c6-550305309413.png" alt="" width="200" height="104" /></p>
<h3 id="f50de1-d27b-b66e-afb0-551b220a0642_Column_Resizing">Column Resizing</h3>
<p>You can easily adjust the size of columns in the forecasting worksheet based on your viewing preference. Simply place your cursor on the column divider, and when the Left and Right arrow appears, click and drag the column to the desired size. The set column width will be preserved when you navigate away from the page. Sugar will render the preferred column size across sessions until the user removes or resets the relevant browser cookies. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/bccc5fe7-2431-4e72-bce9-55030559b975.png" alt="" width="700" height="182" /></p>
<h3 id="f50de1-d27b-b66e-afb0-551b220a0642_Column_Sorting">Column Sorting</h3>
<p>List view provides the ability to sort all of the current search results by a field column in either ascending or descending order. To sort by a field or switch the sort direction, click the column header noting that the fields which allow sorting will have a pair of arrows. Please note that the list view may only be sorted by one column at a time.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a6fe5b04-c0f2-a7d8-e082-5503052c9773.png" alt="" width="700" height="136" /></p>
<h3 id="f50de1-d27b-b66e-afb0-551b220a0642_Column_Selection">Column Selection</h3>
<p>Sugar gives users the ability to personalize the list view by specifying which fields they want displayed in the list view. You can click the Column Selection icon to the far right of the list view column headers to see the list of available fields. Click a field name to toggle whether or not it is included as a column on your list view. Please note that administrators have the ability to configure what fields are available to display on the forecasting worksheet. For more information, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/10_Forecast#Worksheet_Columns">Forecast Configuration</a> documentation in the Administration Guide.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/13fa5012-6d4e-fb3d-b890-550305e94ec1.png" alt="" width="610" height="169" /></p>
<h3 id="f50de1-d27b-b66e-afb0-551b220a0642_Line_Items_and_Totals">Line Items and Totals</h3>
<p>Based on the chosen filters, you will see all or some of your assigned revenue line items for the currently selected time period listed below the Filters bar. On the far left of each row, a blue bar will appear to indicate whether or not the row's amounts are included in the totals for this time period. The presence of the blue bar indicates the row is being counted. In addition to the range called "Include", multiple forecast ranges may be counted towards your totals depending on how your administrator has configured forecast ranges for the instance. For more information about making more than one range included in totals, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/10_Forecast">Forecast Configuration</a> documentation in the Administration Guide. The range and thus the inclusion of each row can be <a href="#f50de1-d27b-b66e-afb0-551b220a0642_Editing_Forecast_Inclusion">changed manually</a> via this view. You can work directly with your revenue line item records by in-line <a href="#f50de1-d27b-b66e-afb0-551b220a0642_Editing_Revenue_Line_Item_Fields">editing their probabilities and amounts</a> from the Forecasts module or by clicking the Name field to open a record in the Revenue Line Items module where you can make additional edits. To the right of each row is a preview button which will allow you to view details about the revenue line item record in your intelligence pane.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/37170b9a-9e8a-701b-ba16-550305746680.png" alt="" width="846" height="199" /></p>
<p>At the bottom of the list, the "Displayed Total" and "Overall Total" rows display sums of the Worst, Likely, and Best amount columns. The Displayed Total row shows the sum of the Worst, Likely, and Best amounts (both included and excluded) displayed on the worksheet based on the filters currently applied. The Overall Total row displays the totals (both included and excluded) of all revenue line items' amounts in this time period regardless of any filters currently applied.</p>
<h4 id="f50de1-d27b-b66e-afb0-551b220a0642_Editing_Forecast_Inclusion">Editing Forecast Inclusion</h4>
<p>The first time a revenue line item is loaded to a worksheet, Sugar will assign it a category of either "Include", "Exclude", "Upside" (optional), or a custom range based on the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/10_Forecast#Ranges">Ranges</a> configured by your administrator. Line items with a higher probability of being won are typically assigned to the Include range while those with a lower probability of being won are designated for the Exclude range. Your administrator may have chosen to use the Upside range or to create a number of other, custom ranges - each with their own non-overlapping range of probabilities. Custom ranges may also exist which have no association to probabilities.</p>
<p>Since one or more ranges may be considered as included depending on your administrators' configuration, the blue bars to the left of each row will update to reflect which items are included and which are excluded based on your updates to each's forecast range.</p>
<p>You may wish to alter the category automatically assigned to your revenue line items by these adminstrator-configured ranges especially as each revenue line item moves forward in the sales process and becomes more likely to be won. To do this, simply click on the line item's current category in the Forecast column and choose the desired category from the dropdown menu.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/f2271921-c11d-d9b0-6834-55028997c057.png" alt="" width="420" height="118" /></p>
<p>Changing a revenue line item's Forecast column to an included range such as "Include" will cause its Likely, Best, and Worst fields to be added to your totals while choosing an excluded range such as "Exclude" will remove the revenue line item's numbers from your totals. Changing which revenue line items are included on your worksheet requires you to <a href="#f50de1-d27b-b66e-afb0-551b220a0642_Saving_Forecast_Drafts">save a draft</a> or <a href="#f50de1-d27b-b66e-afb0-551b220a0642_Committing_Forecasts">commit</a> in order to preserved.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Revenue line items in a Closed Won stage will be included in the worksheet and cannot have their Forecast column altered. Line items in a Closed Lost stage will be excluded from the worksheet and cannot have their Forecast column altered.</p>
<h4 id="f50de1-d27b-b66e-afb0-551b220a0642_Editing_Revenue_Line_Item_Fields">Editing Revenue Line Item Fields</h4>
<p>In addition to editing the inclusion, you can make in-line changes to each revenue line item's fields including Probability, Likely, Best, and Worst. To do so, simply click any field which shows a pencil icon when being hovered over, and enter the new amount. Keep in mind that your worksheet may or may not include "Best" and "Worst" depending on your administrator's <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/10_Forecast#Scenarios">Scenarios</a> configuration. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/bb5ffd40-38b4-2711-5fbc-5502893cdd98.png" alt="" width="320" height="42" /></p>
<p>Clicking outside the text box or pressing Enter/Return will save your change to the line and update the worksheet's totals, summary, and <a href="#f50de1-d27b-b66e-afb0-551b220a0642_be2bb599-03b2-2d5d-7650-55b99f713825_Intelligence_Pane">Intelligence Pane</a> . Clicking the <a href="#f50de1-d27b-b66e-afb0-551b220a0642_Saving_Forecast_Drafts">Save Draft</a> or <a href="#f50de1-d27b-b66e-afb0-551b220a0642_Committing_Forecasts">Commit</a> button will also update the revenue line item records themselves and make your changes visible when viewing the line item in other places in Sugar. Saving a draft or committing is also required to preserve these changes to your worksheet and, in the case of committing, make the changes visible in your manager's Forecasting module.</p>
<h4 id="f50de1-d27b-b66e-afb0-551b220a0642_Currency_Support">Currency Support</h4>
<p>If you use a currency different from your Sugar instance's default currency, your Likely, Best, and Worst amounts will be displayed in the system's default currency in the Forecasting module. Clicking to edit these amount values will, however, display and allow for editing in your chosen currency.</p>
<h3 id="f50de1-d27b-b66e-afb0-551b220a0642_Intelligence_Pane">Intelligence Pane</h3>
<p>To the right of the forecasting worksheet you will find an expandable Intelligence Pane which provides additional insights for planning and forecasting. If the pane is hidden, click the double-arrow button to expand it. Clicking the button again will hide it when you wish to see your worksheet at full width. The Help dashboard normally displays by default along with the Help dashlet. The Help dashlet provides users with a brief introduction to the module along with a link (e.g. Forecasts documentation) to the corresponding documentation in the Application guide. In addition, you can access the Sugar University, Documentation and Support, and Community Forums websites. These links provide access to additional resources available to users. Simply click the appropriate link from the Help dashlet and the pages will open in a separate tab. For more information regarding the Help dashboard, please refer to the <a href="#d03d1-d6ae-25ce-a8e4-551b225ee8d6_Viewing_Via_List_View">Intelligence Pane</a> documentation. You can access the My Dashboard by clicking the triangle to the right of "Help Dashboard" and selecting "My Dashboard". Users may create other dashboards for use with the Forecasts module by clicking the Create button. Selecting "Edit" from the Actions menu on the upper right will allow them to make changes and add additional dashlets (e.g. Saved Reports Chart Dashlet, etc.) to their dashboards.</p>
<p>The My Dashboard has two default dashlets which help provide additional insight into your forecasting worksheet, the <a href="#f50de1-d27b-b66e-afb0-551b220a0642_be47ad6d-c94d-58ad-c5d5-55b99fbea2e3_In_Forecast_Dashlet">In Forecast</a> and <a href="#f50de1-d27b-b66e-afb0-551b220a0642_be4c361c-5c91-3306-a89a-55b99f1db6ba_Forecast_Bar_Chart_Dashlet">Forecast Bar Chart</a> dashlets.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a0bcfde7-88fe-a6d5-d6f6-550305ab8226.png" alt="" width="650" height="295" /></p>
<h4 id="f50de1-d27b-b66e-afb0-551b220a0642_In_Forecast_Dashlet">In Forecast Dashlet</h4>
<p>The In Forecast dashlet appears at the top of the Intelligence Pane and gives a breakdown of how your revenue line items match up to your quota. Keep in mind that your In Forecast dashlet may or may not include "Best" and "Worst" depending on your administrator's <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/10_Forecast#Scenarios">Scenarios</a> configuration.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/695caddd-9cc4-890a-8a47-5503054ef797.png" alt="" width="477" height="294" /></p>
<p>The In Forecast dashlet's values are calculated based on the most recent updates to your worksheet even if the changes have not yet been saved as a draft or committed. The values take all of your revenue line items into account regardless of any filters currently being used in your worksheet. Their meanings are as follows:</p>

<h4 id="f50de1-d27b-b66e-afb0-551b220a0642_Forecast_Bar_Chart_Dashlet">Forecast Bar Chart Dashlet</h4>
<p>The Forecast Bar Chart appears on the bottom of the Intelligence Pane and provides a configurable chart showing different cuts of your forecasting data over the course of the selected time period. Each revenue line item's Expected Close Date field determines in which sub-period it appears. Only the line items currently appearing on your worksheet will appear in your chart meaning that the chart respects your current filters. The Forecast Bar Chart dashlet's values are calculated based on the most recent updates to your worksheet even if the changes have not yet been saved as a draft or committed. Throughout all chart configurations, the dotted black line represents your quota for the given time period and can be hovered over to view the quota amount.</p>
<p>Use the two dropdown menus to control what is displayed in the chart.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a37b4b72-0dea-897c-d60e-550305aa541a.png" alt="" width="280" height="90" /></p>
<p>When "Likely" is chosen, each green point represents the total Likely amounts for all revenue line items currently appearing in your filtered worksheet for that sub-period and any previous sub-periods falling within the selected time period. Choosing "Best" or "Worst" shows the same points using the revenue line items' Best or Worst amounts instead. A green line connects these points showing the change in your possible cumulative amounts.</p>
<p>Each sub-period also displays bars which represent the Likely, Best, or Worst amounts (depending on the chosen dropdown option) for the revenue line items currently appearing in your filtered worksheet. Choosing "In Forecast" will color code segments of these bars according to each revenue line item's Forecast field (i.e. "Include", "Exclude", etc). Choosing "Sales Stage" will color code the bars according to the Stage field of each revenue line item. Choosing "Probability" will color code the bars according to the Probability field of each revenue line item. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/af000d00-249e-a949-72c7-5503059b90e1.png" alt="" width="480" height="401" /></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You may or may not see "Best" and "Worst" as options in the second dropdown depending on your administrator's <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/10_Forecast#Scenarios">Scenarios</a> configuration.</p>
<h2 id="f50de1-d27b-b66e-afb0-551b220a0642_Sales_Managers">Sales Managers</h2>
<p>Sales managers work with their own revenue line item records similarly to other sales representatives. In addition, they aggregate their reportee's committed forecast amounts to predict their total team's sales and work towards the team's quota for the each time period.</p>
<p>When you access the Forecasts module as a sales manager, you will see your name at the top left of the page along with an arrow which allows you to <a href="#f50de1-d27b-b66e-afb0-551b220a0642_Forecast_Drilldown">drill down</a> into your personal worksheet, your team worksheet, and your reportee's worksheets hierarchically. While working with your personal worksheet works similarly to how a regular sales representatives works with their revenue line item, you will also have options such as <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/14_Forecasts/index.html#Time_Periods_2">time period</a> selection, <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/14_Forecasts/index.html#Summary_and_Commit_History_2">summary and commit history</a> , and <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/14_Forecasts/index.html#Filters_2">filters</a> when working with your team worksheet and your reportees' forecasting data.

<h3 id="f50de1-d27b-b66e-afb0-551b220a0642_Forecast_Drilldown">Forecast Drilldown</h3>
<p>Because sales managers are able to see and work with their reportee's revenue line items in addition to their own, these users will see an arrow next to their name at the top left of the Forecasts module. This allows them to drill into team forecasting data and individual sales representatives' line items. By default, Aaron will enter the Forecasts module viewing his team worksheet which includes the total committed amounts and quotas for each immediate reportee and himself.</p>
<h4 id="f50de1-d27b-b66e-afb0-551b220a0642_Own_Line_Items">Own Line Items</h4>
<p>As a manager, Aaron can see and work with his own revenue line items by selecting "Aaron Johnson (me)" from the menu next to his name or from the Name column in his team worksheet below.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/75b88278-81dd-4020-65f6-550289c12205.png" alt="" width="320" height="203" /></p>
<p>While working with his own revenue line items, he will have the same options on his worksheet as a regular sales representative has. For more information on working with a manager's forecasting worksheet, please refer to the<a href="#f50de1-d27b-b66e-afb0-551b220a0642_Line_Items_and_Totals"> Line Items and Totals</a> section of this documentation. Aaron will need to commit his new line items or changes to his line items on his worksheet before the amounts will be reflected on his team worksheet.</p>
<h4 id="f50de1-d27b-b66e-afb0-551b220a0642_Reportees_Line_Items">Reportee's Line Items</h4>
<p>Since Aaron is Ellen's manager, Aaron also has the ability to work with Ellen's committed forecast and revenue line items. He can navigate to her committed worksheet by selecting "Ellen Smith" from the menu next to his name or from the Name column in his team worksheet below.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/ad34f6de-9df1-731d-03ae-55028954fbd8.png" alt="" width="320" height="203" /></p>
<p>While viewing his reportee's worksheet, Aaron will not be able to edit any of the revenue line items' amounts or probabilities.

<p>While viewing his team worksheet, he has the ability to set each team member's quota as well as to set adjusted Likely, Best, and Worst amounts. Please note that your worksheets may or may not include "Best" and "Worst" depending on your administrator's <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/10_Forecast#Scenarios">Scenarios</a> configuration.To edit an adjusted amount or quota, click on the number, enter a new value, and click outside the text box or press Return/Enter. Clicking "Save Draft" will preserve these changes in the worksheet but will not push the changes to other Sugar users. Upon clicking "Commit", these adjusted amounts will be pushed to Aaron's manager thus appearing in Joy's worksheet as his committed amounts. Any changes to quotas will also be pushed to his reportee's worksheets.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a4564edd-fd84-6fa5-02b0-550289fdd70a.png" alt="" width="630" height="152" /></p>
<p>From the team worksheet, managers will see an "i" icon on the far right of each row where there are newly committed changes. Clicking the "i" opens the most recent commit history for that team member.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Although it is possible for Aaron to set or alter his own personal quota, it is recommended that intermediate managers not make changes to their personal quota. Rather, Aaron's manager, Joy, should set the quota for his entire team from her team worksheet.</p>
<h4 id="f50de1-d27b-b66e-afb0-551b220a0642_Management_Hierarchy">Management Hierarchy</h4>
<p>The ability to drill into a reportee's team worksheet and revenue line items continues up the management chain. Joy is Aaron's manager and views her own team worksheet by default when first opening the Forecasts module. She is also able to drill into her own line items by clicking her own name, Aaron's team worksheet by clicking his name, or her other reportee's team worksheet. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/66bd9727-2e7d-c960-ef33-55028985e982.png" alt="" width="270" height="118" /></p>
<p>When Joy navigates to her reportee Aaron's team worksheet, Aaron's name now appears and his team worksheet is displayed in read-only mode. Joy can further drill down to see the worksheets of Aaron's team's members in read-only mode. This drilling can continue recursively down through the management chain as needed. Clicking "Parent" will move up one level of hierarchy, bringing Joy back to her own team worksheet. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a24bcae4-6c1f-02ed-2bf7-550289ba6985.png" alt="" width="270" height="115" /></p>

<p>Below the currently selected drilldown name, you will see the time period for which you are forecasting to meet the time period's quota for your team. The length and start date of this time period depends on the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/10_Forecast#Time_Periods">Time Periods</a> configuration set up by your administrator. At every level of drilldown, sales managers can click the arrow to the right of the current time period and choose a future or past time period, the availability of which is also determined by the administrator's <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/10_Forecast#Time_Periods">Time Periods</a> configuration. Select a past or future time period to work with revenue line items and forecast for those periods. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/61554840-f071-22ed-2f9a-550305b4659d.png" alt="" width="232" height="160" /></p>

<p>To the right below the Time Period selection, you will see a summary of the current forecasting numbers for the time period and drilldown level currently in view. The large numbers are your current worksheet's Quota, Likely, Best, and Worst predictions. The smaller numbers show your most recent commit's Likely, Best, and Worst predictions. Any red or green arrows next to the large numbers on a manager's personal worksheet or own team worksheet show whether your worksheet's current (uncommitted) numbers are higher or lower than the most recent commit. Please note that you may or may not see a Best and Worst depending on your administrator's <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/10_Forecast#Scenarios">Scenarios</a> configuration. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/27fc700e-a195-b5f2-4e08-55030533f265.png" alt="" width="569" height="211" /></p>
<p>To the left of these summary numbers, you will see the date and time of the most recent commit. On a manager's personal worksheet and own team's worksheet, there will be no date and time shown if you have not yet committed for this time period. By clicking the arrow to the right of the latest commit date, a dark grey panel will appear showing a history of the commits for the worksheet currently in view for this time period along with the changes for each forecasting number from the previous commit.</p>
<h3 id="f50de1-d27b-b66e-afb0-551b220a0642_be1b4746-60bb-826f-d74b-55b99fd2a035_Column_Resizing">Column Resizing</h3>
<p>You can easily adjust the size of columns in the forecasting worksheet based on your viewing preference. Simply place your cursor on the column divider, and when the Left and Right arrow appears, click and drag the column to the desired size. The set column width will be preserved when you navigate away from the page. Sugar will render the preferred column size across sessions until the user removes or resets the relevant browser cookies. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/bccc5fe7-2431-4e72-bce9-55030559b975.png" alt="" width="700" height="182" /></p>

<p>Sugar gives users the ability to personalize the list view by specifying which fields they want displayed in the list view. You can click the Column Selection icon to the far right of the list view column headers to see the list of available fields. Click a field name to toggle whether or not it is included as a column on your list view.

<p>Below the summary and commit history of each worksheet, managers will see a filter bar which controls what kinds of revenue line items are displayed. By default, the "Include" filter will be active, meaning that only the revenue line items with a probability falling within the Include range specified during the administrator's <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/10_Forecast#Ranges">Ranges</a> configuration will be displayed. To add additional filters, click within the Filters bar and choose additional ranges. The filter(s) (e.g. Include, Exclude) added to the Filter bar will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the Forecasts module will automatically display the revenue line items based on the filter(s) you last applied.</p>
<p>Please note the Upside or custom ranges may or may not be available depending on the administrator's <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/10_Forecast#Ranges">Ranges</a> configuration. To remove ranges from the filter, click the "x" for each filter name. Removing all filters will display all of your assigned revenue line items. Please note that when viewing your reportee's worksheets, only the revenue line items they have committed as included will be visible. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d74e8f88-63fb-ec19-77c6-550305309413.png" alt="" width="198" height="103" /></p>

<p>To the right of the forecasting worksheet you will find an expandable Intelligence Pane which provides additional insights for planning and forecasting. If the pane is hidden, click the double-arrow button to expand it. Clicking the button again will hide it when you wish to see your worksheets at full width. The Help dashboard normally displays by default along with the Help dashlet. The Help dashlet provides users with a brief introduction to the module along with a link (e.g. Forecasts documentation) to the corresponding documentation in the Application guide. In addition, you can access the Sugar University, Documentation and Support, and Community Forums websites. These links provide access to additional resources available to users. Simply click the appropriate link from the Help dashlet and the pages will open in a separate tab. For more information regarding the Help dashboard, please refer to the <a href="#d03d1-d6ae-25ce-a8e4-551b225ee8d6_Viewing_Via_List_View">Intelligence Pane</a> documentation. You can access the My Dashboard by clicking the triangle to the right of "Help Dashboard" and selecting "My Dashboard". Users may create other dashboards for use with the Forecasts module by clicking the Create button. Selecting "Edit" from the Actions menu on the upper right will allow them to make changes and add additional dashlets (e.g. Saved Reports Chart Dashlet, etc.) to their dashboards.</p>
<p>The My Dashboard has two default dashlets which help provide additional insight into your forecasting worksheet, the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/14_Forecasts/index.html#In_Forecast_Dashlet_2">In Forecast</a> and <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/14_Forecasts/index.html#Forecast_Bar_Chart_Dashlet_2">Forecast Bar Chart</a> dashlets.</p>

<p>The In Forecast dashlet appears at the top of the Intelligence Pane and gives a breakdown of how your revenue line items match up to your quota. Keep in mind that your In Forecast dashlet may or may not include "Best" and "Worst" depending on your administrator's <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/10_Forecast#Scenarios">Scenarios</a> configuration.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a7a061d8-2ee7-6c2d-3629-550305a63f76.png" alt="" width="429" height="375" /></p>
<p>The In Forecast dashlet's values are calculated based on the most recent updates to your worksheet even if the changes have not yet been saved as a draft or committed. The values take all of your revenue line items into account regardless of any filters currently being used in your worksheet. Their meanings are as follows:</p>

<h2 id="d05cd-620a-e8ff-212d-551b22e4c8ee_Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Sugar's Quotes module consists of quotes which specify the quantity and the price per unit for products or services that your organization is selling to clients. You can select a product directly from the product catalog or manually enter a product that is not in the catalog during quote creation. There are various ways you can create quotes in Sugar such as via the Quotes module and duplication. Once created, you can generate the quote in PDF format (i.e. Quote or Invoice) and send it to your clients. This documentation will go over the basics of the Quotes module as well as the various options available in performing the actions related to the module.</p>
<h2 id="d05cd-620a-e8ff-212d-551b22e4c8ee_Quote_Fields">Quote Fields</h2>
<p>The Quotes module contains a number of stock fields which come out-of-the-box with Sugar. The below definitions are suggested meanings for the fields, but the fields can be leveraged differently to best meet your organization's needs. Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to alter, add, or remove fields via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on configuring fields, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Fields">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

<h2 id="d05cd-620a-e8ff-212d-551b22e4c8ee_Creating_Quotes">Creating Quotes</h2>
<p>There are various methods for creating quotes in Sugar including via the Quotes module and duplication. The full edit view layout opens when creating the quote directly from the Quotes menu and includes all of the relevant fields for your organization's quotes. The Edit View layout can be configured by administrators via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on configuring layouts, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Layouts">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<h3 id="d05cd-620a-e8ff-212d-551b22e4c8ee_Creating_Via_Quotes_Module">Creating Via Quotes Module</h3>
<p>One of the most common methods of quote creation is via the Create Quote option in the Quotes module tab. This opens up the edit view layout which allows you to enter in all the relevant information (e.g. Basic Information, Line Items, etc.) for the quote. Once the product details are entered in the quote's line item(s), Sugar will automatically calculate and display the subtotal, discount (if applicable), tax, shipping, and total for each group as well as a grand total for the entire quote.</p>
<h4 id="d05cd-620a-e8ff-212d-551b22e4c8ee_Basic_Information">Basic Information</h4>
<p>The first part of creating a quote is to complete the basic information sections (e.g. Overview, Bill to, Address Information). Enter the appropriate values for the <a href="#d05cd-620a-e8ff-212d-551b22e4c8ee_Quote_Fields">fields</a> in the edit view layout. Please note that all required fields are marked with a red asterisk and must be completed prior to saving. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/73369de0-abe7-f24c-575b-55028d14703c.png" alt="" width="589" height="469" /></p>
<h4 id="d05cd-620a-e8ff-212d-551b22e4c8ee_Adding_Groups">Adding Groups</h4>
<p>The Line Items section allows users to add products from the product catalog and arrange them in groups. Prior to adding the groups and products, you can define the currency, tax rate, shipping provider, etc. if different from the default value selected. Please note that users with administrator or developer access have the ability to configure the Currency, Tax Rate, and Shipping Provider fields via Admin &gt; Currency, Admin &gt; Tax Rates, and Admin &gt; Shipping Providers. For more information on configuring these fields, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/05_System#Currencies">System</a> as well as the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/08_Products_and_Quotes">Products and Quotes</a> documentations. The Display Grand Total and Display Line Numbers checkbox is marked by default, but you can uncheck it if you do not wish to have the grand total or line numbers displayed on the quote.</p>
<p>You can add multiple groups (e.g. chairs, tables, etc.) to your quote to arrange similar products and/or services together for better organization. For example, you can add a group called "Chairs" then add the different types of chairs that the client is purchasing under this group.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to add a new group to your quote:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Scroll to the Line Items panel and click the Add Group button. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/19c5bbb0-93ba-af94-6206-55028d8ac9ee.png" alt="" width="536" height="249" /></li>
    <li>Enter in a group name then click the <a href="#d05cd-620a-e8ff-212d-551b22e4c8ee_Adding_Rows">Add Row</a> button to add products to this group.
        <ul>
            <li>By default, "Draft" is selected as the group stage, but you can change this accordingly.</li>
        </ul><br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a69b7f8c-04f3-7a19-9dfb-55030517990e.png" alt="" width="440" height="140" /></li>
    <li>To delete a group, click the Delete Group button.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/10bbcf54-0241-2896-6dcc-5503059651bd.png" alt="" width="430" height="201" /></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="d05cd-620a-e8ff-212d-551b22e4c8ee_Adding_Rows">Adding Rows</h4>
<p>Once you create a group, use the Add Row feature to add products to the group. You have the option of selecting a product from the product catalog or manually entering a new product, not in the catalog. When you select the product from the catalog, the system automatically populates the manufacturer's number, tax class, cost, list, etc. You cannot modify the line item information for selected products as the value is pulled directly from the product catalog. Please note that system administrators must first create and add products via Admin &gt; Product Catalog in order for users to select it when adding line items. For more information on adding and modifying products in the product catalog, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/08_Products_and_Quotes#Product_Catalog">Product Catalog</a> section of the Product and Quotes documentation. New products entered in the quote can have the manufacturer number, tax class, and pricing information manually entered. Please note that products you manually enter into the quote will not be added to the product catalog as only administrators have the ability to create them.</p>
<p>The product(s) added to each quote line item will create a new record in the Quoted Line Items module when the quote is saved. For more information on creating product records, please refer to the <a href="#a9-4a6b-199c-e4a9-551b22edf7bb_Creating_Quoted_Line_Items">Quoted Line Items</a> documentation.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to add a row and select a product from the Product Catalog:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click "Add Row" in the Group section. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5da605db-89c0-de6a-5ca5-550305111371.png" alt="" width="440" height="138" /></li>
    <li>Click the arrow next to the Product field to select from the Product Catalog list.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/11899549-c6cf-d59a-1e6d-5503058356b4.png" alt="" width="350" height="118" /></li>
    <li>Locate and select the desired product in the pop-up window to add to your group.
        <ul>
            <li>You can also use the Search panel to search for a product by name and category.</li>
        </ul><br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a476cbc6-2454-9eac-cd33-55030541a361.png" alt="" width="600" height="434" /></li>
</ol>
<p>The selected product will be added to the group with the populated line items (grayed out). You can modify the quantity and unit price as well as enter in a discount (if applicable) if you wish. Please note that you can input the discount in absolute price or mark the checkbox if you would like to indicate the discount as a percentage of the unit price. For a description of the line item fields (e.g. Cost, List, etc.), please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/08_Products_and_Quotes#Product_Catalog_Fields">Product Catalog Fields</a> section in the Products and Quotes documentation. Please note that any products that should not be included in the quote can be easily removed by clicking "Remove Row" to the far right of each product row.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5af1e3a7-839a-f899-137d-55030530c468.png" alt="" width="800" height="92" /></p>
<p>Use the following steps to add a row and manually enter a product in the group:</p>

</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Products that are manually entered into quotes will not be added to your product catalog, but will be added as new product records in the Quoted Line Items module.</p>
<h4 id="d05cd-620a-e8ff-212d-551b22e4c8ee_Adding_Comments">Adding Comments</h4>
<p>Users have the option to enter comments for individual products as well as add comments as a line item in the group. Please note that all comments entered will appear on both the Quote and Invoice PDF documents.</p>
<p>Use the open text box below each product to enter any product-related information.</p>

<p>To add a comment for the group, click the Add Comment button and the comment box will be added as a line item. You can remove any group comments that are not needed by clicking "Remove Comment" to the right of the comment box. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/41af4c3d-2e77-dcde-9e98-55028dc9a24f.png" alt="" width="700" height="159" /></p>
<h4 id="d05cd-620a-e8ff-212d-551b22e4c8ee_Rearranging_Line_Items">Rearranging Line Items</h4>
<p>Users also have the ability to rearrange the line items (e.g. groups, rows, comments) to place them in different positions per their personal preference.</p>
<p>The following steps cover moving the Recliner line item to the Ottoman line item location as an example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click the double vertical bar icon to the left of the Recliner line item row. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/3ee60d11-93b2-c474-f2cd-5503057854c2.png" alt="" width="450" height="211" /></li>

</ol>
<p>Once you click the second double bar icon, the Recliner line item will swap positions with the Ottoman line item and display as the second row. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d822e542-ebb9-c539-4389-55030526e53c.png" alt="" width="450" height="211" /></p>
<h3 id="d05cd-620a-e8ff-212d-551b22e4c8ee_Creating_Via_Duplication">Creating Via Duplication</h3>
<p>You can also create a new quote by duplicating an existing quote record. The duplicate option is useful if the quote you are creating has similar information to an existing quote.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Navigate to a quote record's detail view.</li>
    <li>Select "Copy" from the Actions menu. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/94518c46-e080-7fb0-e020-5503053a82b7.png" alt="" width="320" height="135" /></li>

<h2 id="d05cd-620a-e8ff-212d-551b22e4c8ee_Searching_Quotes">Searching Quotes</h2>
<p>The Quotes list view includes a Basic and Advanced Search to help you locate records easily and effectively in a module-specific manner. Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Quotes list view below. Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Please note that Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %services). This will pull up any record that has the word "services" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p>
<p>For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Search">Search</a> documentation.</p>
<h3 id="d05cd-620a-e8ff-212d-551b22e4c8ee_Basic_Search">Basic Search</h3>
<p>Basic search offers a few, commonly used fields for a simplified search experience. From the Basic search panel, you can click "Advanced Search" to access additional search functionality as needed.</p>
<p>The buttons and checkboxes available in the Basic Search panel have the following functions:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Search </strong>: Click the Search button or press your Return/Enter key to perform the search.</li>
    <li><strong>Clear</strong> : Click the Clear button to clear all criteria from the searchable fields.</li>
    <li><strong>My Items</strong> : Select this box to return only records assigned to you.</li>
    <li><strong>My Favorites </strong>: Select this box to return only records you have marked as favorites.</li>
    <li><strong>Open Items</strong> : Select this box to return only records with an open stage (e.g. Draft, Negotiation, etc.).</li>

<p>When you run a search, Sugar will return records matching all (as opposed to any) of the fields and checkboxes for which you have given a value. For example, if you select "My Items" and enter in a quote subject to search, Sugar will only return the quote records with a matching name that are assigned to you. Once the search is complete, the relevant results will populate in the <a href="#d05cd-620a-e8ff-212d-551b22e4c8ee_Quotes_List_View">list view</a> below the search panel. To see all quote records to which you have access, simply click "Clear" and then "Search" to perform a blank search with no filters. Please note that you will only be able to see quote records as allowed by your team membership, user access type, and assigned roles.

<h3 id="d05cd-620a-e8ff-212d-551b22e4c8ee_Advanced_Search">Advanced Search</h3>

<p>When you run a search, Sugar will return records matching all (as opposed to any) of the fields and checkboxes for which you have given a value. For example, if you select "My Favorites" and enter in a quote subject to search, Sugar will only return the quote records with a matching name that are marked as favorites. When searching by a multiselect or dropdown field (e.g. "Assigned to"), however, Sugar will return records matching any of these selections. Once the search completes, the relevant results will populate in the <a href="#d05cd-620a-e8ff-212d-551b22e4c8ee_Quotes_List_View">list view</a> below the search panel.

<h3 id="d05cd-620a-e8ff-212d-551b22e4c8ee_Global_Search">Global Search</h3>
<p>Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Beginning with version 6.5.0, Full Text Search may be used with Global Search to search throughout nearly all fields and modules for an enhanced search experience. The Global Search bar is located on the top right hand side of Sugar. You can click the magnifying glass icon or hit Return/Enter to perform your search once the text string is entered in the search box. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/f45105a7-03d5-1bbe-6f8e-550305bb4763.png" alt="" width="374" height="48" /></p>
<p>To use global search, you need to first enter the keyword into the search box and the pop-up results will begin appearing once you enter in at least one character. Clicking the magnifying glass icon or hitting your Return/Enter key will cause Sugar to return exact matches for your keyword rather than matches with words beginning with your keyword. For more information on using and configuring Global Search, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Global_Search">Global Search</a> section of the Search documentation.</p>
<p>Regular Sugar users can configure some aspects of global search such as what modules are displayed in the search results by clicking the down arrow within the Search box then selecting the module(s) to include in the search. For more information on configuring your Global Search, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Advanced_Options">Search</a> documentation.

<h3 id="d05cd-620a-e8ff-212d-551b22e4c8ee_Pagination">Pagination</h3>
<p>List view displays the current search results broken into pages that you can scroll through rather than potentially displaying thousands of rows at once. To the right just below the search panel you can see which records of the total results set are currently being displayed. The two single-arrow Next and Previous buttons can be used to scroll through the records page-by-page. The two double-arrow First Page and Last Page buttons allow you to skip to the beginning or the end of your current results.</p>
<p>By default, Sugar displays 20 records per list view page, but administrators can change the number of records displayed via Admin &gt; System Settings.

<p>Users have the option to mark quote records as a favorite via the detail view as well as the list view. This allows users to designate records that are important or will be viewed often as they can easily be accessed via search or from the Quotes module tab. In the Quotes detail view, the star on the right of the quote's name is yellow once marked to indicate a favorite quote. For more information on how to mark records as favorites, please refer to the <a href="#d05cd-620a-e8ff-212d-551b22e4c8ee_Favoriting_Quotes">Favoriting Quotes</a> section of this documentation. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5e7659c5-b2b1-b06a-361e-55028da57713.png" alt="" width="328" height="129" /></p>
<h3 id="d05cd-620a-e8ff-212d-551b22e4c8ee_Next_or_Previous_Record">Next or Previous Record</h3>
<p>On the upper right of the Quotes detail view, there are two buttons that allow you to page through each quote in the Quotes list view's current search results. Clicking the Previous button displays the previous quote of the current search results while clicking the Next button displays the next quote of the current search results. The text in between shows which quote result you are currently viewing within the total number of current results. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/542ee21c-97af-7ed9-7c6b-55028da2e30d.png" alt="" width="606" height="119" /></p>
<h3 id="d05cd-620a-e8ff-212d-551b22e4c8ee_Subpanels">Subpanels</h3>
<p>Beneath a quote record's fields are subpanels containing related records from various modules.</p>
<h4 id="d05cd-620a-e8ff-212d-551b22e4c8ee_Related_Record_Subpanels">Related Record Subpanels</h4>
<p>The most common type of subpanel displayed on a quote's detail view contain the quote's related records belonging to the Documents module. The relationship type determines whether a related record will be displayed in the field listing or in a subpanel. For example, multiple quotes may be related to an opportunity, which means that the related opportunity will be displayed in a relate field in the quote's Overview panel.</p>
<p>Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to change the fields (e.g. Name, Assigned User, etc.) and labels of the subpanel by configuring the layout via Admin &gt; Studio to provide visibility to the most important fields. For more information on modifying subpanels, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Editing_Subpanels">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<p>Related record subpanels allow the following operations to be performed. Please note that administrators in Sugar can change the subpanel's Action menu to be displayed as separate buttons instead of a dropdown via Admin &gt; System Settings. For more information, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/05_System#User_Interface">System</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<ul>
    <li>To view the details of a related record, click the record's name in the subpanel to open it in record view (for Sidecar modules) or detail view (for Legacy modules).</li>
    <li>To relate an existing record to the quote, choose "Select" from the subpanel's Action menu, then locate and select the desired record.</li>
    <li>To relate a new record to the quote, choose "Create" from the subpanel's Action menu, then complete the Quick Create form and click "Save".</li>
    <li>To delete the quote's relationship to a record, choose "Unlink" from the dropdown on the far right of the record's row. This removes the relationship, but does not delete the record itself.</li>
    <li>To collapse or expand the subpanel, click the double arrow to the left of the subpanel's name.</li>
    <li>To move the subpanel to a new location on the detail view, drag and drop the subpanel's header.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that administrators can prevent users from moving subpanels to different locations in the detail view. For more information on preventing rearranging of subpanels, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/05_System#User_Interface">System</a> documentation in the Administration guide. Check with your system administrator if you are not able to rearrange your subpanels. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/4aad2fde-810b-f3e0-ef11-55028d943a14.png" alt="" width="724" height="117" /></p>
<h4 id="d05cd-620a-e8ff-212d-551b22e4c8ee_Activities_and_History_Subpanel">Activities and History Subpanel</h4>
<p>The Activities subpanel lists open or upcoming tasks, calls, and meetings that are related to the quote record. Once the activities have taken place or are completed, they will instead appear within the History subpanel. The History subpanel also includes notes and emails associated with the quote record. For more information on the history and activities subpanel, please refer to the <a href="#f0900-c879-cb1e-8ff3-551b221d70e0_Historical_Summary">User Interface</a> documentation.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/ed2fbd5f-e9c6-5284-190f-55028d20c8a0.png" alt="" width="680" height="209" /></p>
<h2 id="d05cd-620a-e8ff-212d-551b22e4c8ee_Editing_Quotes">Editing Quotes</h2>
<p>Quotes may be edited at any time to update or add information to the record. You can make changes to existing quote records via the Quotes edit view. The edit view is available within the Quotes module and includes all of the Quote fields you should need. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/86480690-b7fb-305c-8cca-55028d157a4c.png" alt="" width="318" height="169" /></p>

<h2 id="d05cd-620a-e8ff-212d-551b22e4c8ee_Deleting_Quotes">Deleting Quotes</h2>
<p>If a quote record is invalid or should no longer appear in your organization's Sugar instance, it may be deleted from either the Quotes detail view or list view. Deleting via the detail view allows you to delete a single record while the list view allows for mass deleting multiple records at once. Deleting quote records will not delete the related records and will only remove the relationship, so you may wish to also delete any related records to avoid orphaned records.</p>
<p>Please note that your ability to delete quotes in Sugar may be restricted by a role. For more information on roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide.

<p>Due to PHP memory limitations on the server, there may be occasions when the application times out while deleting a large number of quote records. If you encounter an error when performing this action, we recommend selecting the records in smaller batches.</p>
<h2 id="d05cd-620a-e8ff-212d-551b22e4c8ee_Exporting_Quotes">Exporting Quotes</h2>
<p>Sugar's Export option allows users to download all fields for the selected quotes to their computers as a .CSV (comma-separated values) file. This may be useful when needing to use Quote data with other software such as Microsoft Excel. Due to PHP memory limitations on the server, there may be occasions when the application times out while exporting a large number of quote records. If you encounter an error when performing this action, we recommend selecting the records in smaller batches.</p>
<p>Quotes may be exported from the Quotes list view by selecting "Export" from the Actions menu. Users with access to the Reports module also have the option of creating or accessing reports containing specifically chosen fields for quotes and their related record(s).

<p>Mass Updating allows users to make the same change to multiple quote records at once from the Quotes list view. Users with administrator or developer level access can control which fields are available to change during mass update via Admin &gt; Studio. Currently, only fields with the data type of date, datetime, dropdown, multiselect, and radio may be altered during a mass update. For more information on configuring mass update, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Field_Options">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.

<h2 id="d05cd-620a-e8ff-212d-551b22e4c8ee_Creating_Opportunities_from_Quotes">Creating Opportunities from Quotes</h2>
<p>Each opportunity record in Sugar represents a prospective sale and includes relevant sales data as well as relating to other important records such as quotes, contacts, etc. As you interact with your client and present the quote for your products and services, you can create an opportunity from the Quotes detail view to better track your sales. The displayed Opportunity record view is pre-populated with the original quote's values to reflect the opportunity name, account name, expected close date, best, likely, and worst amounts. Any other fields populated will be based off the default values as they are defined in Studio for the Opportunities module. Please note that the opportunity record will automatically be associated to the quote. Also, each quoted line item of the quote will become a revenue line item associated to the newly created opportunity record.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to create an opportunity from a quote:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to a quote's detail view.</li>
    <li>Select "Create Opportunity from Quote" from the Actions menu. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8222745f-a049-b5ff-f86b-5503055f20d9.png" alt="" width="300" height="145" /></li>
    <li>The newly created Opportunity record will be pre-populated with some of the original quote's values and linked to the quote record.
        <ul>
            <li>You may update the record if you wish by clicking "Edit" then saving the changes.</li>
            <li><strong>Note</strong>: Revenue line items are automatically generated for the opportunity based on the quoted line items in the original quote.</li>
        </ul><br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/59c32207-5000-e57d-6931-550305a0f417.png" alt="" width="500" height="187" /></li>

<h2 id="d05cd-620a-e8ff-212d-551b22e4c8ee_Downloading_Quotes_as_PDFs">Downloading Quotes as PDFs</h2>
<p>Users have the option to download the quotes as PDF's via the Quotes detail view. The two formats available when downloading the quote to PDF is "Quote" and "Invoice". The Download PDF option enables you to easily download the quote onto your machine and email or mail it to your client outside of the Sugar application. Both PDF formats list the details (e.g. quantity, product name, etc.) of the items or services for purchase as well as the associated price (e.g. list price, unit price, tax, total, etc.). When the quote is initially created in the system, you can download it as a Quote PDF file and send it to the client for review. Once the client approves the quote's terms and agrees to purchase your product or service, you can generate an invoice for payment.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to download a quote as PDF:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to a quote record's detail view.</li>
    <li>Hover on the Download PDF option in the Actions menu and choose either "Quote" or "Invoice". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/edb7f3ee-3fca-48e1-4f0d-550305cde3b4.png" alt="" width="300" height="197" /></li>

<h2 id="d05cd-620a-e8ff-212d-551b22e4c8ee_Emailing_Quotes_as_PDFs">Emailing Quotes as PDFs</h2>
<p>Users also have the option to email quotes to clients in <a href="#d05cd-620a-e8ff-212d-551b22e4c8ee_Emailing_Quotes_as_PDFs">PDF format</a> (i.e. Quote or Invoice) using Sugar's email client. The Email PDF option generates and attaches the PDF document of the quote to be emailed to the client. Both the Quote and Invoice formats list the details (e.g. quantity, product name, etc.) of the items or services for purchase as well as the associated price (e.g. list price, unit price, tax, total, etc.). Normally, the quote will be sent to the client to approve the quote's terms then the invoice is sent once they agree to purchase your product or service.</p>
<p>Please note that administrators in Sugar must first configure the outbound mail server for the system via Admin &gt; Email Settings in order for users to send outbound emails. For more information on setting up the system email settings, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/06_Email#Email_Settings">Emails</a> documentation in the Administration guide. Users will also need to have their email settings configured in their user preferences prior to sending outbound email from the Emails module. For more information on setting up your user preferences' email settings, please refer to the <a href="#e-543f-551b22c2c01c___Email_Settings">Getting Started</a> documentation.</p>

<h2 id="d05cd-620a-e8ff-212d-551b22e4c8ee_Viewing_Quote_Change_Logs">Viewing Quote Change Logs</h2>
<p>Changes made to each quote record are tracked over time, and users are able to view the history of changes via the change log in each quote's detail view. To view the change log, navigate to a quote's detail view and select "View Change Log" from the Actions menu. Please note that only fields marked as "Audit" in Admin &gt; Studio will be displayed in the change log. For more information on designating for audit, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Field_Options">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a394aea1-4a33-dacb-a756-550305f080ce.png" alt="" width="310" height="212" /></p>
<h2 id="d05cd-620a-e8ff-212d-551b22e4c8ee_Updating_Currency_Rates">Updating Currency Rates</h2>
<p>When saving a quote in a currency that differs from the system-defined default currency, Sugar will store the conversion rate for that currency at the record level. This conversion rate is used to calculate the Converted Amount when the field is set to use the system default currency (as opposed to the user's preferred currency which is explained below). To keep amounts historically accurate, the conversion rate will only update on a quote provided the quote stage is not set to "Closed Accepted", "Closed Lost", or "Closed Dead". If the quote is in any other stage, the conversion rate will update under the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The quote undergoes a save event (e.g. mass update, manual save, etc.) and the record's currency has a different conversion rate defined in Admin &gt; Currencies than is currently saved in the quote.</li>
    <li>An administrator updates the currency exchange rate under Admin &gt; Currencies. This will trigger a scheduled job which updates all quotes saved with that currency to the new rate.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the viewing user's profile has the Show Preferred Currency option selected, the Converted Amount field displays the Transactional Amount in the user's preferred currency. In this case, the conversion rate used to calculate the Converted Amount's value is drawn directly from the conversion rate at the system level rather than any conversion rate stored on the record. This means that the value will always use the current conversion rate regardless of the opportunity's sales stage. For this reason, the Converted Amount field should not be considered historically accurate for closed quotes when it is using the user's preferred currency. For information about setting a user's Preferred Currency and Show Preferred Currency options, please refer to the <a href="#e-543f-551b22c2c01c_Locale_Settings">Getting Started</a> documentation.</p>
<p>For more information about currency exchange rates, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/05_System/#Currencies">System</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

<h2 id="a9-4a6b-199c-e4a9-551b22edf7bb_Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Sugar's Quoted Line Items module consists of all products that have already been sold or are in the process of being sold to clients. The list of products sold by your organization is housed in Admin &gt; Product Catalog and administrators have the ability to add products as necessary. When creating quoted line items, you have the option to either select products from the catalog or create new products via the Quoted Line Items module. There are various ways you can create quoted line items in Sugar such as via the Quoted Line Items module, Quotes module, duplication, importing quoted line items, etc. Once the quoted line item record is created, you can view and edit information pertaining to the quoted line item via the Quoted Line Items record view. This documentation will cover how to use the Quoted Line Items module as well as the various actions and options available from within the module.</p>
<h2 id="a9-4a6b-199c-e4a9-551b22edf7bb_Quoted_Line_Item_Fields">Quoted Line Item Fields</h2>
<p>The Quoted Line Items module contains a number of stock fields which come out-of-the-box with Sugar. The below definitions are suggested meanings for the fields, but the fields can be leveraged differently to best meet your organization's needs. Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to alter, add, or remove fields via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on configuring fields, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Fields">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

Please note that Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %services). This will pull up any record that has the word "services" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p>
<p>For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Search">Search</a> documentation.</p>

<h3 id="a9-4a6b-199c-e4a9-551b22edf7bb_Subpanels">Subpanels</h3>
<p>Beneath a quoted line item record's fields are subpanels containing related records from various modules. Selecting the Data View button will display the subpanels rather than the record's activity stream.</p>
<h4 id="a9-4a6b-199c-e4a9-551b22edf7bb_Filter_Options">Filter Options</h4>
<p>While in Data View, all of the quoted line item record's related records will be displayed beneath the record's fields. Users have the ability to search for records which appear in the subpanels as well as filter the view to only display a specific module (e.g. Documents). To locate a record by name, enter the keyword into the Search bar, and the subpanel(s) with the matching record(s) will appear below. To filter, simply click the Related option to the far left of the Search bar and select the module whose subpanel you wish to view. Filter and search may be combined to only display matching records within a selected module. To see all subpanels to which you have access, simply select "All" in the Related options and remove any text from the search bar.When you run a search using a saved or created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the page.Returning to the page will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/802389d7-9c61-d8c6-c11c-55030842d9a6.png" alt="" width="725" height="109" /></p>
<p>When a Sidecar module (e.g. Notes) is selected from the Related options, you have the option to filter the related subpanels further using one of the available options (e.g. My Favorites, Recently Created, etc.). Please note that you can also create custom filters for related Sidecar modules. Once the related module (e.g. Notes) is selected, either click the Filter option and select "Create" or click "Create" to the right of the Filter option. For more information on creating related records filter, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Creating_a_Related_Records_Filter">Creating a Related Records Filter</a> section of the Search documentation.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/43a4e027-55b6-0a62-6a74-55030881ed4f.png" alt="" width="696" height="255" /></p>
<h4 id="a9-4a6b-199c-e4a9-551b22edf7bb_Reordering_Subpanels">Reordering Subpanels</h4>
<p>Users can easily move subpanels to a new location on the record view by dragging and dropping the subpanel's header. The new subpanel order will remain for a user upon subsequent visits to the module until the user's browser cache is cleared.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b24b8ccb-cb3b-6964-2600-5563e46c52a1.png" alt="QLI ReorderingSubpanels1" width="713" height="302" /></p>
<h4 id="a9-4a6b-199c-e4a9-551b22edf7bb_Related_Record_Subpanels">Related Record Subpanels</h4>
<p>The type of subpanel displayed out-of-the-box on a quoted line item's record view is the Documents and Related Quoted Line Items subpanel. For every relationship between two modules, the relationship type determines whether a related record will be displayed in the field listing or in a subpanel. Quoted line items may be related to multiple documents, so the associated documents will be displayed in a subpanel below the record's fields.</p>
<p>Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to change the fields (e.g. Name, Status, etc.) and labels of the subpanel by configuring the layout via Admin &gt; Studio to provide visibility to the most important fields. For more information on modifying subpanels, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Editing_Subpanels">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<p>Related record subpanels allow the following operations to be performed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To view the details of a related record, click the record's name in the subpanel to open it in record view.</li>
    <li>To relate an existing record to the quoted line item, choose "Link Existing Record" from the subpanel's Action menu, then locate and select the desired record.</li>
    <li>To relate a new record to the quoted line item, click the Plus button to the left of the Actions menu, then complete the record view layout and click "Save".</li>
    <li>To delete the quoted line item's relationship to a record, choose "Unlink" from the Actions menu on the far right of the record's row. This removes the relationship, but does not delete the record itself.</li>
    <li>To mark the record as a favorite, click the star icon to the left of the desired record's row.</li>
    <li>To collapse or expand the subpanel, click the Up arrow to the left of the Plus button.</li>
    <li>To change the column size in the subpanel, place your cursor on the column divider and when the Left and Right arrow appears, click and drag the column to the desired size. Please note that the column width will not be preserved when you navigate away from the page.</li>

<h2 id="a9-4a6b-199c-e4a9-551b22edf7bb_Finding_Duplicate_Quoted_Line_Items">Finding Duplicate Quoted Line Items</h2>
<p>Between multiple users working in Sugar, importing new records, etc. it is possible for duplicate quoted line item records to be accidentally input to the system. Before creating a new quoted line item record, a good practice is to first check that the quoted line item does not already exist in Sugar. You can locate duplicate records for cleanup using <a href="#a9-4a6b-199c-e4a9-551b22edf7bb_Module_Search">module search</a> from the Quoted Line Items list view. Searching for quoted line items with similar names or other information can turn search into a powerful, duplicates-finding tool. Sugar also provides a wizard for finding potential duplicates that is available from the Quoted Line Items record view and may be used as shown below. If duplicate quoted line item records are detected, you can perform a merge per the <a href="#a9-4a6b-199c-e4a9-551b22edf7bb_Merging_Quoted_Line_Items">Merging Quoted Line Items</a> section of this documentation.</p>
<p>Please note that your ability to use the Find Duplicates action may be restricted by any role which prevents quoted line item deletion. For more information on roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide. Check with your system administrator if you do not see the Find Duplicates option.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to locate duplicate quoted line items using the Find Duplicates option from the Quoted Line Items record view:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to a quoted line item's record view.</li>
    <li>Choose "Find Duplicates" from the Actions menu. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/3d3997f8-44d4-700f-ef44-550308f8210b.png" alt="" width="400" height="103" /></li>
    <li>Potential duplicate quoted line item records will be listed on the Find Duplicates page. Select the duplicate record(s) you wish to merge then click "Merge Duplicates".
        <ul>
            <li>You can preview the duplicate record's details by clicking the Preview button to the far right of the records row.</li>
            <li>You can search for specific records from the Quoted Line Items list view if you wish to check for more possible duplicates. For more information on performing a search, please refer to the <a href="#a9-4a6b-199c-e4a9-551b22edf7bb_Module_Search">Module Search</a> section of this documentation.</li>
            <li>You can also click the Column Selection icon above the Preview button to change the list of fields that display on the list view column headers.</li>

<p>Once you click "Merge Duplicates", the merging process with the current record will begin. For instructions on performing the merge that follows, please refer to Steps 3-9 of the <a href="#a9-4a6b-199c-e4a9-551b22edf7bb_Merging_Via_List_View">Merging Via List View</a> section of this documentation.</p>
<h2 id="a9-4a6b-199c-e4a9-551b22edf7bb_Merging_Quoted_Line_Items">Merging Quoted Line Items</h2>
<p>When duplicate records are identified in Sugar, you have the option to merge two or more quoted line items into a single record. Once the merge is complete, the duplicate quoted line item record(s) will be deleted, and the primary record will remain. Please note that all relationships belonging to the duplicate quoted line items will be merged to the primary record with the related records now linked to the resulting, merged quoted line item record.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Date Created, Date Modified, and Password field types are not supported when merging duplicate records in Sugar.</p>

<h2 id="a9-4a6b-199c-e4a9-551b22edf7bb_Updating_CurrencyRates">Updating CurrencyRates</h2>
<p>When saving a quoted line itemin a currency that differs from the system-defined default currency, Sugar will store the conversion rate for that currency at the record level. This conversion rate is used to calculate the converted amountswhen they are set to use the system default currency (as opposed to the user's preferred currency which is explained below). To keep amounts historically accurate, the conversion rate will only update on a quoted line itemprovided the status is not set to "Shipped". If the line itemis in any other sales stage, the conversion rate will update under the followingscenarios:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The quoted line itemundergoes a save event (e.g. mass update, manual save, etc.) and the record's currency has a different conversion rate defined in Admin &gt; Currencies than is currently saved in the line item.</li>
    <li>An administrator updates the currency exchange rate under Admin &gt; Currencies. This will trigger a scheduled job which updates all quoted line itemssaved with that currency to the newrate.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the viewing user's profile has the Show Preferred Currency option selected, the converted amountfields display in the user's preferred currency. In this case, the conversion rate is drawn directly from the conversion rate at the system level rather than any conversion rate stored on the record. This means that the value will always use the current conversion rate regardless of the quoted line item'sstatus. For this reason, the Price and List fields should not be considered historically accurate for closed business when it is using the user's preferred currency. For information about setting a user's Preferred Currency and Show Preferred Currency options, please refer to the<a href="#e-543f-551b22c2c01c_Locale_Settings">User Profile</a> documentation.</p>

<h2 id="fc498dd-2822-2a2b-e9d3-556e2a06229a_Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Sugar's Contracts module consists of individual business arrangements your organization has with vendors, customers, or association. There are various ways you can create contracts in Sugar such as via the Contracts module, importing contracts, duplication, etc. Once the contract record is created, you can view and edit information pertaining to the contract via the Contracts detail view. Each contract record may then relate to other Sugar records such as opportunities, documents, quotes, and many others. This documentation will cover how to use the Contracts module as well as the various actions and options available from within the module.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This module is hidden by default. The administrator must display it for your use.</p>
<h2 id="fc498dd-2822-2a2b-e9d3-556e2a06229a_Contract_Fields">Contract Fields</h2>
<p>The Contracts module contains a number of stock fields which come out-of-the-box with Sugar. The below definitions are suggested meanings for the fields, but the fields can be leveraged differently to best meet your organization's needs. Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to alter, add, or remove fields via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on configuring fields, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Fields">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

<h2 id="fc498dd-2822-2a2b-e9d3-556e2a06229a_Creating_Contracts">Creating Contracts</h2>
<p>There are various methods for creating contracts in Sugar including via the Contracts module, quick create, duplication, and importing contracts. The full edit view layout opens when creating the contract directly from the Contracts menu and includes all of the relevant fields for your organization's contracts. The quick create form is a shortened version of the contracts edit view and typically contains fewer fields. When using quick create to make a contract while viewing an existing record of another module, Sugar automatically creates a relationship between both records. For example, if you are viewing an account record (e.g. ABC Company) and create a new contract via the quick create form, the Account Name field in the contract record will automatically populate with "ABC Company", thus creating the relationship. Both the Edit View and Quick Create layouts can be configured by administrators via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on configuring layouts, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Layouts">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

<h2 id="fc498dd-2822-2a2b-e9d3-556e2a06229a_Searching_Contracts">Searching Contracts</h2>
<p>The Contracts list view includes a Basic and Advanced Search to help you locate records easily and effectively in a module-specific manner. Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Contracts list view below. Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Please note that Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %services). This will pull up any record that has the word "services" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends. <br />For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/03_Search#List_View_Search_%28Sidecar_Modules%29">Search</a> documentation.</p>

<h3 id="fc498dd-2822-2a2b-e9d3-556e2a06229a_Pagination">Pagination</h3>
<p>List view displays the current search results broken into pages that you can scroll through rather than displaying potentially thousands of rows at once. To the right just below the search panel you can see which records of the total results set are currently being displayed. The two single-arrow Next and Previous buttons can be used to scroll through the records page-by-page. The two double-arrow First Page and Last Page buttons allow you to skip to the beginning or the end of your current results.</p>
<p>By default, Sugar displays 20 records per list view page, but administrators can change the number of records displayed via Admin &gt; System Settings. For more information on changing the number of displayed records, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/05_System#User_Interface">System</a> documentation in the Administration guide.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/c57b1728-764b-0dc9-2b16-5565ff5a7974.png" alt="Contracts Listview Pagination7.6" width="544" height="97" /></p>

<h3 id="fc498dd-2822-2a2b-e9d3-556e2a06229a_Related_Record_Subpanels">Related Record Subpanels</h3>
<p>The most common type of subpanels displayed on a contract's detail view contain the contract's related records belonging to various modules. The relationship type determines whether a related record will be displayed in the field listing or in a subpanel. For example, a contract may be related to only one account but related to multiple contacts. This means that the related account will be displayed amongst the contract's fields while contacts will be displayed in a subpanel beneath the fields. <br />Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to change the fields (e.g. Name, Assigned User, etc.) and labels of each subpanel by configuring the layout via Admin &gt; Studio to provide visibility to the most important fields. For more information on modifying subpanels, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Subpanels">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide. <br />Related record subpanels allow the following operations to be performed. Please note that administrators in Sugar can change the subpanel's Action menu to be displayed as separate buttons instead of a dropdown via Admin &gt; System Settings. For more information, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/05_System#User_Interface">System</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<ul>
    <li>To view the details of a related record, click the record's name in the subpanel to open it in detail view.</li>
    <li>To relate an existing record to the contract, choose "Select" from the subpanel's Action menu, then locate and select the desired record.</li>
    <li>To relate a new record to the contract, choose "Create" from the subpanel's Action menu, then complete the Quick Create form and click "Save".</li>
    <li>To edit a related record, choose "Edit" on the far right of the record's row.</li>
    <li>To delete the contract's relationship to a record, choose "Unlink" from the dropdown on the far right of the record's row. This removes the relationship, but does not delete the record itself.</li>
    <li>To collapse or expand the subpanel, click the double arrow to the left of the subpanel's name.</li>
    <li>To move the subpanel to a new location on the detail view, drag and drop the subpanel's header.</li>
</ul>

For more information on preventing rearranging of subpanels, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/05_System#User_Interface">System</a> documentation in the Administration guide.

<h4 id="fc498dd-2822-2a2b-e9d3-556e2a06229a_Signing_Documents">Signing Documents</h4>
<p>The documents subpanel gives users the ability to create and select documents to be attached to the contract record. Template documents give users the ability to perform additional actions on the document through the contracts module. This feature is best used for a standard contract or agreement document that the organization will have to sign. Once the contract is signed by the organization, users can click "Sign" on the related document record. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8f450ad1-8db2-8150-ddaa-550309d6f641.png" alt="" width="427" height="65" /></p>
<p>This prompts the user to create a new document record for the signed contract, which will be related to the template document as well as the contract record. You will now see both documents, the original contract template and the signed contract, in the documents subpanel of the contract record. <br /><br />Once a document related to a contract gets revised you have the option of pulling the latest revision to be linked to the contract. Otherwise the version of the document that existed when linked to the contract will remain linked. Click "Get Latest" to link the most recent version of the document to the contract. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/23a51e00-a336-eb73-2ad8-5503091d92fc.png" alt="" width="424" height="101" /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e46611f1-2117-0d07-a747-5503091dee06.png" alt="" width="670" height="87" /></p>
<h2 id="fc498dd-2822-2a2b-e9d3-556e2a06229a_Editing_Contracts">Editing Contracts</h2>
<p>Contracts may be edited at any time to update or add information to the record. You can make changes to existing contract records via the Contracts edit view and quick create forms. Edit view is available within the Contracts module and includes all of the Contract fields you should need. <br /><br />Quick create is available for editing contracts from outside the Contracts module and opens as a pop-up without navigating away from your current page. It generally contains fewer fields, but the Full Form button may be used to access the full edit view should you need to edit additional fields. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e5a943e5-48ad-0aaf-9acc-550309e9c051.png" alt="" width="340" height="526" /><br />Please note that your ability to edit contracts in Sugar may be restricted by a role.

<p>If a contract record is invalid or should no longer appear in your organization's Sugar instance, it may be deleted from either the Contracts detail view or list view. Deleting via the detail view allows you to delete a single record while the list view allows for mass deleting multiple records at once. Deleting contract records will not delete the related records and will only remove the relationship, so you may wish to also delete any related records to avoid orphaned records. <br />Please note that your ability to delete contracts may be restricted by a role.

<p>Sugar's Documents module gives your users a way to access and update company-specific files. These files can range from internal policies to customer-distributed content. There are various ways you can create documents in Sugar such as via the Documents module and via the quick create menu. Once the document record is created, you can view and edit information pertaining to the document via the Documents detail view. Each document record may then relate to other Sugar records such as accounts, cases, opportunities, and many others. This documentation will cover how to use the Documents module as well as the various actions and options available from within the module.</p>
<h2 id="c47c4274-c8b9-d0dc-e199-556648b3a734_Document_Fields">Document Fields</h2>
<p>The Documents module contains a number of stock fields which come out-of-the-box with Sugar. The below definitions are suggested meanings for the fields, but the fields can be leveraged differently to best meet your organization's needs. Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to alter, add, or remove fields via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on configuring fields, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Fields">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

    <h2 id="c47c4274-c8b9-d0dc-e199-556648b3a734_Searching_Documents">Searching Documents</h2>
    <p>The Documents list view includes a Basic and Advanced Search to help you locate records easily and effectively in a module-specific manner. Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Documents list view below. Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Please note that Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %agreement). This will pull up any record that has the word "agreement" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends. <br />For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/03_Search#List_View_Search_%28Sidecar_Modules%29">Search</a> documentation.</p>

For example, if you select "My Favorites" and enter a document name, Sugar will only return document records with a matching name that you have marked as favorites. Once the search is complete, the relevant results will populate in the list view below the search panel. To see all document records to which you have access, simply click "Clear" and then "Search" to perform a blank search with no filters.

    <div>
        <p>Users have the option to mark document records as a favorite via the detail view as well as the list view. This allows users to designate records that are important or will be viewed often so that they can easily be accessed via search or from the Documents module tab.

    <p>Beneath a document record's fields are subpanels containing related records from various modules as well as the document revision history.</p>
    <h4 id="c47c4274-c8b9-d0dc-e199-556648b3a734_Related_Records_Subpanels">Related Records Subpanels</h4>
    <p>The most common type of subpanels displayed on a document's detail view contains the document's related records belonging to various modules. The relationship type determines whether a related record will be displayed in the field listing or in a subpanel. For example, a document may be related to only one other document but related to multiple accounts. This means that the related document will be displayed amongst the document's fields while accounts will be displayed in a subpanel beneath the fields.</p>
    <p>Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to change the fields (e.g. Name, Assigned User, etc.) and labels of each subpanel by configuring the layout via Admin &gt; Studio to provide visibility to the most important fields. For more information modifying subpanels, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Subpanels">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
    <p>Related record subpanels allow the following operations to be performed. Please note that administrators in Sugar can change the subpanel's Action menu to be displayed as separate buttons instead of a dropdown via Admin &gt; System Settings. For more information, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/05_System#User_Interface">System</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To view the details of a related record, click the record's name in the subpanel or choose "View" from the Actions menu on the far right of the record's row to open it in record view.</li>
        <li>To relate an existing record to the document, choose "Select" from the subpanel's Action menu, then locate and select the desired record.</li>
        <li>To relate a new record to the document, choose "Create" from the subpanel's Action menu, then complete the record view layout and click "Save".</li>
        <li>To delete the document's relationship to a record, choose "unlink" from the Actions menu on the far right of a record's row. This removes the relationship, but does not delete the record itself.</li>
        <li>To collapse or expand the subpanel, click the double arrow to the left of the subpanel's name.</li>
        <li>To move the subpanel to a new location on the detail view, drag and drop the subpanel's header.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please note that administrators can prevent users from moving subpanels to different locations in the detail view. For more information on preventing rearranging of subpanels, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/05_System#User_Interface">System</a> documentation in the Administration guide. Check with your system administrator if you are not able to rearrange your subpanels. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/aa99ac7c-88e4-1b48-fd7e-5566257e1561.png" alt="Documents RelatedRecordSubpanel 7.x" width="725" height="158" /></p>
    <h4 id="c47c4274-c8b9-d0dc-e199-556648b3a734_Document_Revisions_Subpanel">Document Revisions Subpanel</h4>
    <p>The Document Revisions subpanel lists the document revisions for this document record. The revisions are sorted in descending order on the revision number by default. Each revision retains the copy of the document loaded on that revision. This provides you with the ability to look back at the history of the document to compare revisions.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/4e4ba981-c733-0bff-e24f-55662846c9bf.png" alt="Documents DocumentRevisionsSubpanel 7.x" width="454" height="167" /><br /><strong>Note</strong>: This does not work as expected with External Documents (e.g. Google Docs, IBM Smart Cloud) as the document is not stored in Sugar for these document sources, but only a link to the document. To retain change history, either utilize Google Doc's change features, or select a different document for every revision.</p>
    <p>You can click the Create button on this subpanel to create a new revision of the document you are currently viewing. The revision number is automatically populated with the current highest revision number plus one, but can be modified.</p>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: If you skip numbers, it will not go back and fill in the missing numbers. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/2b6e4ed6-8027-b5a9-f93f-556628ed5b18.png" alt="Documents DocumentRevisions Create Save 7.x" width="560" height="198" /><br />You may also populate the Change Log field with a short description of the change being made for this revision. Click "Save" to complete the revision record.</p>
    <h2 id="c47c4274-c8b9-d0dc-e199-556648b3a734_Editing_Documents">Editing Documents</h2>
    <p>Documents may be edited at any time to update or add information to the record. You can make changes to existing document records via the Documents edit view. Edit view is available within the Documents module and includes all of the Document fields you should need. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8ca58ca0-4a46-9194-ddf9-556629046fa3.png" alt="Documents Edit 7.x" width="612" height="179" /></p>

    <h2 id="c47c4274-c8b9-d0dc-e199-556648b3a734_Deleting_Documents">Deleting Documents</h2>
    <p>If a document record is invalid or should no longer appear in your organization's Sugar instance, it may be deleted from either the Documents detail view or list view. Deleting via the detail view allows you to delete a single record while the list view allows for mass deleting multiple records at once. Deleting document records will not delete the related records and will only remove the relationship, so you may wish to also delete any related records to avoid orphaned records. Document revision records will be deleted when deleting the parent document record. <br />Please note that your ability to delete documents in Sugar may be restricted by a role.

<p>Sugar's Calendar module allows users to easily schedule, view, and manage their activities (e.g. calls, meetings, tasks) in one place. The calendar will show your calls, meetings, and tasks provided you are an invitee on the call or meeting, or the task is assigned to you. You can also view other user's scheduled activities via the shared calendar option. This documentation will cover how to use the Calendar module as well as the various actions and options available from within the module.</p>
<h2 id="a0f3d-202d-3646-bbe6-551b22c512e6_Calendar_Module_Tab">Calendar Module Tab</h2>
<p>The Calendar module tab is typically found by clicking the arrow to the right of the module tabs on the navigation bar. The additional modules will appear on the list and you can click "Calendar" to access your calendar. Once the Calendar Lists tab displays on the navigation bar, you can click the triangle within the tab to display the Actions menu, which allows you to perform important actions within the module.</p>

<h2 id="a0f3d-202d-3646-bbe6-551b22c512e6_Creating_Activities">Creating Activities</h2>
<p>There are various methods for creating the different activities available in Sugar, including via the calendar itself, the Calendar module's actions menu, the individual activity's module, or via quick create. The record view opens in edit mode when creating the call directly from the Calls menu, Quick Create menu, and Calendar module and includes all of the relevant fields for your organization. When using quick create to make a call while viewing an existing record of another module, Sugar automatically creates a relationship between both records. For example, if you are viewing a contact record (e.g. John Smith) and create a new call via its record view, the Related To field in the call record will automatically populate with "John Smith", thus creating the relationship and adding him as an invitee. The record view layout can be configured by administrators via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on configuring layouts, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio/#Layouts">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<h3 id="a0f3d-202d-3646-bbe6-551b22c512e6_Creating_Via_Calendar_Grid">Creating Via Calendar Grid</h3>
<p>The calendar allows you to create meetings and calls easily by clicking on the cell corresponding to the specific date and time you wish to schedule the activity. The record view will appear in edit mode, and the start date and time will automatically be populated based on the date and time cell you selected in the calendar.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to create an activity (e.g. meeting) via the calendar grid:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click the Calendar module tab.</li>
    <li>On the calendar view, click the cell corresponding to the date and time you wish to schedule the meeting. You can choose to view the calendar by Day, Week, Month, Year, or Shared. For more information on viewing the shared calendar, please refer to the <a href="#a0f3d-202d-3646-bbe6-551b22c512e6_Viewing_Shared_Calendar">Viewing Shared Calendar</a> section of this documentation.<img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b1a8699b-2946-9f14-8758-550303172207.png" alt="" width="650" height="225" /><br />When a cell is selected on the calendar, a Meeting record view will appear in edit mode. A popup will also appear giving users to option to create a new call or a new task instead.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5b1566f6-2e22-41c6-7c34-550303ea326f.png" alt="" width="616" height="152" /></li>

<p>The Calendar module allows you to view not just your own activities, but you can also view the calendar of other Sugar users using the Shared Calendar. The calendar will show the selected user in a weekly view on one page. Using the shared calendar, users will also have the option to create activities for other users directly from the calendar. For more information on using the shared calendar, please refer to the <a href="#a0f3d-202d-3646-bbe6-551b22c512e6_Shared_Calendar">Shared Calendar</a> section of this documentation.</p>
<p>Please note that you will only be able to see activity records as allowed by your team membership, user access type, and assigned roles. For more information on teams and roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/031_Team_Management">Teams</a> and <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Roles</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

<p>The Sugar calendar allows for the start time and duration of meetings and calls to be edited from the calendar, instead of having to directly edit the activity record via the module. The records that appear on the calendar can also be dragged and dropped to new locations to change the start date and time.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: All occurrences of <a href="#a0f3d-202d-3646-bbe6-551b22c512e6_Editing_Recurring_Meetings_and_Calls">recurring</a> meetings and calls cannot be modified by dragging one record of the series. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5dfecac4-4cee-b76b-ff14-550303b96236.png" alt="" width="463" height="253" /><br />In addition, the activities can be dragged from the bottom of the box to be able to change the duration of the activity. To do this, simply hover over the activity's box to make the two lines appear at the bottom. Click the two lines and drag to the new end time of the call or meeting. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8507ea33-f55f-ecf3-7dfb-55030387a595.png" alt="" width="332" height="275" /></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Changing the meeting details with drag-and-drop does not send a system-generated update to the meeting invitees.</p>
<h3 id="a0f3d-202d-3646-bbe6-551b22c512e6_More_Information">More Information</h3>
<p>Additional details for each activity can be viewed by clicking the "i" icon on the far right of each activity block on the calendar. This provides users a quick view of additional information in addition to what appears on the block. The pop-up window can also be used to access the record. Click the Pencil button to edit the record in the record view, the Preview button to view the record, or the "X" button to close the pop-up window.</p>

    <li>Once the necessary information is entered, click "Save" or, if you would like an invitation email to go out to the invitees where they can accept or deny the call or meeting, click "Save and Send Invites".</li>
</ol>
<p>The record view can also be reached by clicking the Pencil button on the More Information pop-up for the activity.

<p>When a meeting or call is set to be recurring, additional copies or duplicates of the call or meeting record are created for the specific time and date of each recurrence. Therefore, editing one record's cell on the calendar will not affect the other recurrences of the same call or meeting and will only affect the one recurrence you are editing. Users must select Edit All Recurrences from the meeting record's Action Menu.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/3d6e7d3a-1b8a-554e-3ded-55030385292e.png" alt="" width="538" height="332" /></p>

<p>Sugar's module consists of open, upcoming, or closed call records logged by users in your organization. There are various ways you can create calls in Sugar such as via the module, Calendar module, importing calls, etc. Users can also log calls via the Activities subpanel (for Legacy modules) or Planned Activities dashlet (for Sidecar modules) on related module records (e.g. Contacts, Accounts, Leads, etc.), which automatically creates a relationship between both records. Once the call record is created, you can view and edit information pertaining to the call via the record view. This documentation will cover how to use the module as well as the various actions and options available from within the module.</p>
<h2 id="ca03a8-8eeb-1e77-bc02-551b2206312f_Call_Fields">Call Fields</h2>
<p>The module contains a number of stock fields which come out-of-the-box with Sugar. The below definitions are suggested meanings for the fields, but the fields can be leveraged differently to best meet your organization's needs. Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to alter, add, or remove fields via Admin &gt; Studio.

<h2 id="ca03a8-8eeb-1e77-bc02-551b2206312f_Creating_Calls">Creating Calls</h2>
<p>There are various methods for creating calls in Sugar including via the module, Calendar module, quick create, duplication, and import. The record view opens in edit mode when creating the call directly from the menu, Quick Create menu, and the Calendar module and includes all of the relevant fields for your organization. When using quick create to make a call while viewing an existing record of another module, Sugar automatically creates a relationship between both records. For example, if you are viewing a contact or lead record (e.g. John Smith) and create a new call via their record view, the Related To field in the call record will automatically populate to "John Smith", thus creating the relationship and adding him as an invitee, as well as adding his associated account. Please note that if a call is created through the subpanel in a contact or lead record, they can not be removed as an invitee during the creation process. The record view layout can be configured by administrators via Admin &gt; Studio.</p>
<p>For more information on configuring layouts, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Layouts">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

<h2 id="ca03a8-8eeb-1e77-bc02-551b2206312f_Searching_Calls">Searching Calls</h2>
<p>The Calls list view includes a Basic and Advanced Search to help you locate records easily and effectively in a module-specific manner. Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Calls list view below. Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Please note that Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %review). This will pull up any record that has the word "review" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p>
<p>For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Search">Search</a> documentation.</p>
<h3 id="ca03a8-8eeb-1e77-bc02-551b2206312f_Module_Search">Module Search</h3>
<p>Module search enables users to easily search by call name within the Calls module and pull up matching records in the list view. The search also provides a Filter option which can be used in combination with the open Search box to narrow your search further using the available options as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Create</strong> : Create a new custom filter which you can use to filter your search
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Note</strong>: You can also click "Create" to the right of the Filter option.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>All Calls</strong> : Returns all records in the module to which you have access</li>
    <li><strong>My Calls </strong>: Returns only records assigned to you</li>
    <li><strong>My Favorites</strong> : Returns only records you have marked as favorites</li>
    <li><strong>Recently Created </strong>: Returns only records you created in the module within the last 7 days</li>
    <li><strong>Recently Viewed </strong>: Returns only records you have viewed in the module within the last 7 days<img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8022912b-91e2-11e3-a5e2-550308a472c7.png" alt="" width="278" height="310" /></li>
</ul>
<p>When you choose a filter, Sugar will return calls which match both the selected filter and any name provided in the "Search by name..." bar in the filtered list view results. For example, if you select "My Calls" in the Filter options and enter a call name, Sugar will only return call records with a matching name that are assigned to you. Once the search is complete, the relevant results will populate in the <a href="#ca03a8-8eeb-1e77-bc02-551b2206312f_Calls_List_View">list view</a> below the search bar. To see all call records to which you have access, simply select the All Calls option in the filter and remove any text from the search bar. You can also click the Clear icon within the selected filter option (e.g. My Calls) in the Search bar to clear the filter and pull up all list view search results. When you run a search using a saved or created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. In addition, searches using the open Search box only or in combination with advanced filters (e.g. My Favorites) are preserved as well when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/58ce2506-22d7-00f1-2494-5503084f6ac2.png" alt="" width="272" height="311" /></p>
<p>Please note that you will only be able to see call records as allowed by your team membership, user access type, and assigned roles. For more information on teams and roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/031_Team_Management">Team Management</a> and <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide. Administrators can configure what fields appear on the Calls Module Search via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on editing layouts, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Editing_Layouts">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<h4 id="ca03a8-8eeb-1e77-bc02-551b2206312f_Creating_a_Filter">Creating a Filter</h4>
<p>Users can also create new filters via the Create option in the Filter list of the search bar. This allows users to add custom, complex filter options when searching in the Calls list view. You have the option to add multiple fields to your new filter by clicking the Plus button to the right of the filter selection dropdown lists and set select operators along with their value(s). A filter's criteria needs to be true for a record in order for it to appear in the list view search result. Additionally, filters with no specified values may be saved as a custom filter to act as a filter template when a user often searches using the same fields but with varying values. Please note that only fields you have view access for will appear in the Filter list when creating a search filter.</p>
<p>When you run a search using a created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter.</p>
<p>The following steps cover creating a new Assigned to filter as an example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click the Filter option on the Calls search bar then select "Create".
        <ul>
            <li>You can also click "Create" to the right of the Filter option.</li>

    <li>Select the field you wish to add to your filter as well as the condition and matching criteria.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Note</strong>: Only fields you have view access for will be available to add in the Filter list.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>To add additional fields to the new filter, click the Plus button to the right of the filter.
        <ul>
            <li>To remove fields from the new filter, click the Minus button to the right of the filter.</li>
            <li>To clear any filter values (e.g. Sarah Smith), simply click the "x" to the right of the value or select "Reset" to the left of the Save button.</li>
        </ul><br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e17da174-a174-e4b2-daa5-550308f930a1.png" alt="" width="614" height="376" /></li>
</ol>
<p>The list view will automatically display results matching your filters as you create and modify the criteria.</p>
<h4 id="ca03a8-8eeb-1e77-bc02-551b2206312f_Saving_a_Filter">Saving a Filter</h4>
<p>Saving a filter will preserve the chosen fields as well as the condition(s) of the matching value(s). Additionally, it will allow users to easily select previously created and saved filters from the Filter options.</p>
<p>The following steps cover saving a new search by Name filter as an example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Create a <a href="#ca03a8-8eeb-1e77-bc02-551b2206312f_Creating_a_Filter">new filter</a> to perform a search on your desired fields.</li>
    <li>Enter in a name for the new filter (e.g. "assigned to Sarah"). <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/981f60d2-1d62-16f5-5467-550308911afb.png" alt="" width="630" height="146" /></li>
    <li>Click "Save" to add this filter to the module's Filter options.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="ca03a8-8eeb-1e77-bc02-551b2206312f_Global_Search">Global Search</h3>
<p>Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Beginning with version 6.5.0, Full Text Search is used with Global Search to search throughout nearly all fields and modules for an enhanced search experience. The Global Search bar is located on the top right hand side of Sugar. You can click the magnifying glass icon or hit Return/Enter to perform your search once the text string is entered in the search box.</p>
<p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/45000f9c-5b11-a0be-854c-550302b230fa.png" alt="" width="319" height="42" /></p>
<p>To use global search, you need to first enter the keyword into the search box and the pop-up results will begin appearing once you enter in at least one character. Clicking the magnifying glass icon or hitting your Return/Enter key will cause Sugar to return exact matches for your keyword rather than matches with words beginning with your keyword. For more information on using and configuring Global Search, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Global_Search">Global Search</a> section of the Search documentation.</p>
<p>Regular Sugar users can configure some aspects of global search such as what modules are displayed in the search results by clicking the down arrow within the search box then selecting the module(s) to include in the search. For more information on configuring your Global Search, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Advanced_Options">Search</a> documentation.

<p>Users have the option to mark call records as favorites via the record view as well as the list view. This allows users to designate records that are important or will be viewed often so that they can easily be accessed via the search filter or from the Calls module tab. In the Calls record view, the star on the right of the call's name is grey once favorited. For more information on how to mark records as favorites, please refer to the <a href="#ca03a8-8eeb-1e77-bc02-551b2206312f_Favoriting_Calls">Favoriting Calls</a> section of this documentation. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/10b2578c-dc98-9b97-dbfc-5503085bf70e.png" alt="" width="366" height="106" /></p>

<h3 id="ca03a8-8eeb-1e77-bc02-551b2206312f_Subpanels">Subpanels</h3>
<p>Beneath a call record's fields is the subpanel containing related records. By default, only the Notes subpanel displays in the module. Administrators can create new relationships between various modules in Sugar to create additional subpanels. For more information on creating relationships, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio/#Relationships">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide. Select the Data View button to display the subpanel rather than the record's activity stream.</p>
<h4 id="ca03a8-8eeb-1e77-bc02-551b2206312f_Filter_Options">Filter Options</h4>
<p>While in Data View, all of the call record's related records will be displayed beneath the call record's fields. Users have the ability to search for records which appear in the subpanels as well as filter the view to only display a specific module (e.g. Notes). To locate a record by name, enter the keyword into the Search bar. If additional subpanels have been configured, click the Related option to the far left of the Search bar to select the module whose subpanel you wish to view. Filter and search may be combined to only display matching records within a selected module. To see all subpanels to which you have access, simply select "All" in the Related options and remove any text from the search bar. When you run a search using a saved or created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the page. In addition, searches using the open Search box only or in combination with advanced filters (e.g. My Favorites) are preserved as well when you navigate away from the page.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d45ad6be-bf85-fb7a-a3de-5503099580e5.png" alt="" width="609" height="152" /></p>
<p>When a Sidecar module (e.g. Notes) is selected from the Related options, you have the option to filter the related subpanels further using one of the available options (e.g. My Favorites, Recently Created, etc.). Please note that you can also create custom filters for related Sidecar modules. Once the related module is selected, either click the Filter option and select "Create" or click "Create" to the right of the Filter option.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/2e97be13-47f7-0376-d052-550309dd05a8.png" alt="" width="618" height="269" /></p>
<h4 id="ca03a8-8eeb-1e77-bc02-551b2206312f_Reordering_Subpanels">Reordering Subpanels</h4>
<p>Users can easily move subpanels to a new location on the record view by dragging and dropping the subpanel's header. The new subpanel order will remain for a user upon subsequent visits to the module until the user's browser cache is cleared.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: By default, only the Notes subpanel displays in the module. Administrators can create new relationships between various modules in Sugar to create additional subpanels. For more information on creating relationships, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio/#Relationships">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<h4 id="ca03a8-8eeb-1e77-bc02-551b2206312f_Related_Record_Subpanels">Related Record Subpanels</h4>
<p>Subpanels displayed on a Calls record view contain the call's related records belonging to various modules. A module's relationship to the module determines whether a related record will be displayed in the field listing or in a subpanel. For example, a call may be related to multiple notes, which means that the related notes will be displayed in a subpanel beneath the fields.</p>
<p>Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to change the fields (e.g. Subject, Assigned User, etc.) and labels of each subpanel by configuring the layout via Admin &gt; Studio to provide visibility to the most important fields. For more information on modifying subpanels, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Editing_Subpanels">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<p>Related record subpanels allow the following operations to be performed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To view the details of a related record, click the record's name in the subpanel to open it in record view.</li>
    <li>To relate an existing record to the call, choose "Link Existing Record" from the subpanel's Action menu, then locate and select the desired record. Please note that the Link Existing Record option is not available when the relationship is required in the related module.</li>
    <li>To relate a new record to the call, click the Plus button to the left of the Actions menu, then complete the record view layout and click "Save".</li>
    <li>To preview the related record, click the Preview icon to the far right of the record's row in the subpanel.</li>
    <li>To inline edit the record directly from the subpanel, choose "Edit" from the Actions menu on the far right of the record's row and click "Save" to preserve the change.</li>
    <li>To delete the call's relationship to a record, choose "Unlink" from the Actions menu on the far right of the record's row. This removes the relationship, but does not delete the record itself. Please note that the Unlink option is not available when the relationship is required in the related module.</li>
    <li>To mark the record as a favorite, click the star icon to the left of the desired record's row.</li>
    <li>To collapse or expand the subpanel, click the Up arrow to the left of the Plus button.</li>
    <li>To change the column size in the subpanel, place your cursor on the column divider and, when the Left and Right arrow appears, click and drag the column to the desired size. Please note that the column width will not be preserved when you navigate away from the page.</li>

<h2 id="ca03a8-8eeb-1e77-bc02-551b2206312f_Adding_Reminders">Adding Reminders</h2>
<p>Sugar includes the ability to remind invitees when they have a call that is scheduled to begin in a given amount of time. Reminders can be sent via email to all of the invitees prior to the calls scheduled start date and time. By default, reminders have to be manually added to calls upon creating or editing the activity. Users can configure their default reminders via their <a href="#e-543f-551b22c2c01c_User_Preferences">User Preferences</a>, which will automatically select the default reminder time in the Reminders field.</p>
<p>The instance's outbound mail server must be configured via Admin &gt; Email Settings in order for email reminders to be sent out. For more information on setting up the system email settings, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/06_Email#Email_Settings">Email</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<h4 id="ca03a8-8eeb-1e77-bc02-551b2206312f_Email_Reminders">Email Reminders</h4>

<h2 id="ca03a8-8eeb-1e77-bc02-551b2206312f_Closing_Calls">Closing Calls</h2>
<p>Once a call has taken place or is complete, users can edit the Status field to "Held" while on the record view. Outside of the directly editing the field, Sugar provides users with alternative options to close calls as "Held" via the list view or record view. Please note that the Close option will only appear on the list view or record view if the call currently has a status that does not equal "Held".</p>

<h3 id="ca03a8-8eeb-1e77-bc02-551b2206312f_Exporting_Calls">Exporting Calls</h3>
<p>Sugar's Export option allows users to download all fields for the selected calls to their computers as a .CSV (comma-separated values) file. This may be useful when needing to use Call data with other software such as Microsoft Excel or to update existing records by exporting, making changes, then importing the altered calls back into Sugar. For more information on updating existing records via import, please refer to the <a href="#f-87f1-f338-50da-551b227d034a_Importing_Updates_to_Existing_Records">Import</a> documentation. Due to PHP memory limitations on the server, there may be occasions when the application times out while exporting a large number of call records. If you encounter an error when performing this action, we recommend selecting the records in smaller batches.</p>
<p>Calls may be exported from the Calls list view by selecting "Export" from the Actions menu. Users with access to the Reports module also have the option of creating or accessing reports containing specifically chosen fields for calls and their related record(s). Please note that only Rows and Columns-type reports have the ability to be exported. For more information on exporting records in Sugar, please refer to the <a href="#e6004c-15af-3450-3b7e-551b22bbe5d2_Export">Export</a> documentation. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8c83c0ab-83f1-4958-3f1c-550309217c77.png" alt="" width="259" height="291" /></p>

<h2 id="c-ab7d-7fa6-3fc9-551b220669ab_Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Sugar's Meetings module consists of open, upcoming, or closed meeting records logged by users in your organization. There are various ways you can create meetings in Sugar such as via the Meetings module, Calendar module, importing meetings, etc. Users can also schedule meetings via the Activities subpanel (for Legacy modules) or Planned Activities dashlet (for Sidecar modules) on related module records (e.g. Contacts, Accounts, Leads, etc.), which automatically creates a relationship between both records. Once the meeting record is created, you can view and edit information pertaining to the meeting via the Meetings record view. This documentation will cover how to use the Meetings module as well as the various actions and options available from within the module.</p>
<h2 id="c-ab7d-7fa6-3fc9-551b220669ab_Meeting_Fields">Meeting Fields</h2>
<p>The Meetings module contains a number of stock fields which come out-of-the-box with Sugar. The below definitions are suggested meanings for the fields, but the fields can be leveraged differently to best meet your organization's needs. Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to alter, add, or remove fields via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on configuring fields, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Fields">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

<h2 id="c-ab7d-7fa6-3fc9-551b220669ab_Creating_Meetings">Creating Meetings</h2>
<p>There are various methods for creating meetings in Sugar including via the Meetings module, Calendar module, quick create, duplication, and import. The record view opens in edit mode when creating the meeting directly from the Meetings menu, Quick Create menu , and Calendar module and includes all of the relevant fields for your organization. When using quick create to make a meeting while viewing an existing record of another module, Sugar automatically creates a relationship between both records. For example, if you are viewing a contact or lead record (e.g. John Smith) and create a new meeting via their record view, the Related To field in the meeting record will automatically populate to "John Smith", thus creating the relationship and adding him as an invitee, as well as adding his associated account. Please note that if a meeting is created through the subpanel in a contact or lead record, they can not be removed as an invitee during the creation process. The record view layout can be configured by administrators via Admin &gt; Studio.</p>
<p>For more information on configuring layouts, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Layouts">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

<h2 id="c-ab7d-7fa6-3fc9-551b220669ab_Searching_Meetings">Searching Meetings</h2>
<p>The Meetings list view includes a Basic and Advanced Search to help you locate records easily and effectively in a module-specific manner. Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Meetings list view below. Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Please note that Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %review). This will pull up any record that has the word "review" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p>
<p>For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Search">Search</a> documentation.</p>
<h3 id="c-ab7d-7fa6-3fc9-551b220669ab_Module_Search">Module Search</h3>
<p>Module search enables users to easily search by meeting name within the Meetings module and pull up matching records in the list view. The search also provides a Filter option which can be used in combination with the open Search box to narrow your search further using the available options as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Create</strong> : Create a new custom filter which you can use to filter your search
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Note</strong>: You can also click "Create" to the right of the Filter option.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>All Meetings</strong> : Returns all records in the module to which you have access</li>
    <li><strong>My Meetings </strong>: Returns only records assigned to you</li>
    <li><strong>My Favorites</strong> : Returns only records you have marked as favorites</li>
    <li><strong>Recently Created </strong>: Returns only records you created in the module within the last 7 days</li>
    <li><strong>Recently Viewed </strong>: Returns only records you have viewed in the module within the last 7 days</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/35b5aa66-1269-53d2-b0c3-55030386a40b.png" alt="" width="375" height="284" /></p>
<p>When you choose a filter, Sugar will return meetings which match both the selected filter and any name provided in the "Search by name..." bar in the filtered list view results. For example, if you select "My Meetings" in the Filter options and enter a meeting name, Sugar will only return meeting records with a matching name that are assigned to you. Once the search is complete, the relevant results will populate in the <a href="#c-ab7d-7fa6-3fc9-551b220669ab_Meetings_List_View">list view</a> below the search bar. To see all meeting records to which you have access, simply select the All Meetings option in the filter and remove any text from the search bar. You can also click the Clear icon within the selected filter option (e.g. My Meetings) in the Search bar to clear the filter and pull up all list view search results. When you run a search using a saved or created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. In addition, searches using the open Search box only or in combination with advanced filters (e.g. My Favorites) are preserved as well when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/cae74897-bfd7-0216-670a-550303f8638e.png" alt="" width="368" height="269" /></p>

<h4 id="c-ab7d-7fa6-3fc9-551b220669ab_Creating_a_Filter">Creating a Filter</h4>
<p>Users can also create new filters via the Create option in the Filter list of the search bar. This allows users to add custom, complex filter options when searching in the Meetings list view. You have the option to add multiple fields to your new filter by clicking the Plus button to the right of the filter selection dropdown lists and set select operators along with their value(s). A filter's criteria needs to be true for a record in order for it to appear in the list view search result. Additionally, filters with no specified values may be saved as a custom filter to act as a filter template when a user often searches using the same fields but with varying values. Please note that only fields you have view access for will appear in the Filter list when creating a search filter.</p>
<p>When you run a search using a created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter.</p>
<p>The following steps cover creating a new Assigned to filter as an example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click the Filter option on the Meetings search bar then select "Create".
        <ul>
            <li>You can also click "Create" to the right of the Filter option.</li>

    <li>Select the field you wish to add to your filter as well as the condition and matching criteria.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Note</strong>: Only fields you have view access for will be available to add in the Filter list.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>To add additional fields to the new filter, click the Plus button to the right of the filter.
        <ul>
            <li>To remove fields from the new filter, click the Minus button to the right of the filter.</li>
            <li>To clear any filter values (e.g. Sarah Smith), simply click the "x" to the right of the value or select "Reset" to the left of the Save button.</li>
        </ul><br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/461cb172-5d4d-a3ca-d39f-550303a9a6e7.png" alt="" width="614" height="316" /></li>
</ol>
<p>The list view will automatically display results matching your filters as you create and modify the criteria.</p>
<h4 id="c-ab7d-7fa6-3fc9-551b220669ab_Saving_a_Filter">Saving a Filter</h4>
<p>Saving a filter will preserve the chosen fields as well as the condition(s) of the matching value(s). Additionally, it will allow users to easily select previously created and saved filters from the Filter options.</p>
<p>The following steps cover saving a new search by Name filter as an example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Create a <a href="#c-ab7d-7fa6-3fc9-551b220669ab_Creating_a_Filter">new filter</a> to perform a search on your desired fields.</li>
    <li>Enter in a name for the new filter (e.g. "Meetings assigned to Sarah"). <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8258c8f8-e231-009f-0c13-5503038f0e5a.png" alt="" width="633" height="107" /></li>
    <li>Click "Save" to add this filter to the module's Filter options.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="c-ab7d-7fa6-3fc9-551b220669ab_Global_Search">Global Search</h3>
<p>Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Beginning with version 6.5.0, Full Text Search is used with Global Search to search throughout nearly all fields and modules for an enhanced search experience. The Global Search bar is located on the top right hand side of Sugar. You can click the magnifying glass icon or hit Return/Enter to perform your search once the text string is entered in the search box.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/45000f9c-5b11-a0be-854c-550302b230fa.png" alt="" width="319" height="42" /></p>
<p>To use global search, you need to first enter the keyword into the search box and the pop-up results will begin appearing once you enter in at least one character. Clicking the magnifying glass icon or hitting your Return/Enter key will cause Sugar to return exact matches for your keyword rather than matches with words beginning with your keyword. For more information on using and configuring Global Search, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Global_Search">Global Search</a> section of the Search documentation.</p>

Simply place your cursor on the column divider, and when the Left and Right arrow appears, click and drag the column to the desired size. The set column width will be preserved when you navigate away from the page. Sugar will render the preferred column size across sessions until the user removes or resets the relevant browser cookies. You can reset the column width back to the default size by clicking the Gear icon to the far right of the list view column headers and selecting "Reset default widths". Please note that this option only appears if at least one of the column widths in the current list view is different from the default column width.

<p><strong>Note</strong>: By default, only the Notes subpanel displays in the Meetings module. Administrators can create new relationships between various modules in Sugar to create additional subpanels. For more information on creating relationships, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio/#Relationships">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<h4 id="c-ab7d-7fa6-3fc9-551b220669ab_Related_Record_Subpanels">Related Record Subpanels</h4>
<p>Subpanels displayed on a meeting's record view contain the meeting's related records belonging to various modules. A module's relationship to the Meetings module determines whether a related record will be displayed in the field listing or in a subpanel. For example, a meeting may be related to multiple notes, which means that the related notes will be displayed in a subpanel beneath the fields.</p>
<p>Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to change the fields (e.g. Subject, Assigned User, etc.) and labels of each subpanel by configuring the layout via Admin &gt; Studio to provide visibility to the most important fields. For more information on modifying subpanels, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Editing_Subpanels">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<p>Related record subpanels allow the following operations to be performed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To view the details of a related record, click the record's name in the subpanel to open it in record view.</li>
    <li>To relate an existing record to the meeting, choose "Link Existing Record" from the subpanel's Action menu, then locate and select the desired record. Please note that the Link Existing Record option is not available when the relationship is required in the related module.</li>
    <li>To relate a new record to the meeting, click the Plus button to the left of the Actions menu, then complete the record view layout and click "Save".</li>
    <li>To preview the related record, click the Preview icon to the far right of the record's row in the subpanel.</li>
    <li>To inline edit the record directly from the subpanel, choose "Edit" from the Actions menu on the far right of the record's row and click "Save" to preserve the change.</li>
    <li>To delete the meeting's relationship to a record, choose "Unlink" from the Actions menu on the far right of the record's row. This removes the relationship, but does not delete the record itself. Please note that the Unlink option is not available when the relationship is required in the related module.</li>
    <li>To mark the record as a favorite, click the star icon to the left of the desired record's row.</li>
    <li>To collapse or expand the subpanel, click the Up arrow to the left of the Plus button.</li>
    <li>To change the column size in the subpanel, place your cursor on the column divider and, when the Left and Right arrow appears, click and drag the column to the desired size. Please note that the column width will not be preserved when you navigate away from the page.</li>

<p>An intelligence pane displays to the right of the meeting's record view and provides users with valuable information specific to the meeting's sales, activities, etc. The Help Dashboard normally displays by default along with the Record View Help dashlet and Learning Resources dashlet. The Record View Help dashlet provides users with a brief introduction to the module along with some instructions to help users utilize and navigate around the record view. A link to the corresponding documentation (e.g. Meetings documentation) in the Application guide is also provided within the Help dashlet. The Learning Resources dashlet includes links to Sugar University, Community Forums, and Documentation &amp; Support, which provide access to additional resources. Simply click the appropriate link to be directed to the specific page in a separate tab. For more information regarding the Help dashboard, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/01_Sugar_Ultimate/Sugar_Ultimate_7.5/Application_Guide/02_User_Interface/15_Intelligence_Pane#Viewing_Via_Record_View">Intelligence Pane</a> documentation. You can access the My Dashboard, which will display some stock dashlets (e.g. Planned Activities dashlet, History dashlet , etc.) by clicking the triangle to the right of "Help Dashboard" and selecting "My Dashboard". For example, the History dashlet displays calls and meetings that have taken place as well as related emails for the account record. By default, the Opportunity Metrics, Case Summary, News Feed, Planned Activities, and History dashlets are available in the stock dashboard called "My Dashboard". Users may choose to view any of their dashboards using the triangle to the right of the current dashboard's name and may create other dashboards for use with the Meetings module by clicking the Create button. Selecting "Edit" from the Actions menu on the upper right will allow them to make changes and add additional dashlets to their dashboards.</p>
<p>Users can edit individual dashlets by clicking the Gear icon on the upper right of each dashlet. Dashlets may also be dragged and dropped to rearrange them within the current dashboard. You can collapse dashlets you do not wish to view by clicking the Up arrow on the upper right of the dashlet. Sugar will remember the state of your intelligence pane the next time you return to the Meetings module.

<h2 id="c-ab7d-7fa6-3fc9-551b220669ab_Deleting_Meetings">Deleting Meetings</h2>
<p>If a meeting record is invalid or should no longer appear in your organization's Sugar instance, it may be deleted from either the Meetings record view or list view. Deleting via the record view allows you to delete a single record while the list view allows for mass deleting multiple records at once as well as single record deletions. Deleting meeting records will not delete the related records and will only remove the relationship, so you may wish to also delete any related records to avoid orphaned records.</p>
<p>Please note that your ability to delete meetings in Sugar may be restricted by a role.

<h4 id="c-ab7d-7fa6-3fc9-551b220669ab_Adding_Reminders">Adding Reminders</h4>
<p>Sugar includes the ability to remind invitees when they have a meeting that is scheduled to begin in a given amount of time. Reminders can be sent via email to all of the invitees prior to the meetings scheduled start date and time. By default, reminders have to be manually added to meeting upon creating or editing the activity. Users can configure their default reminders via their <a href="#e-543f-551b22c2c01c_User_Preferences">User Preferences</a>, which will automatically select the default reminder time in the Reminders field.</p>
<p>The instance's outbound mail server must be configured via Admin &gt; Email Settings in order for email reminders to be sent out. For more information on setting up the system email settings, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/06_Email#Email_Settings">Email</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

<h3 id="c-ab7d-7fa6-3fc9-551b220669ab_Exporting_Meetings">Exporting Meetings</h3>
<p>Sugar's Export option allows users to download all fields for the selected meetings to their computers as a .CSV (comma-separated values) file. This may be useful when needing to use Meeting data with other software such as Microsoft Excel or to update existing records by exporting, making changes, then importing the altered meetings back into Sugar. For more information on updating existing records via import, please refer to the <a href="#f-87f1-f338-50da-551b227d034a_Importing_Updates_to_Existing_Records">Import</a> documentation. Due to PHP memory limitations on the server, there may be occasions when the application times out while exporting a large number of meetings records. If you encounter an error when performing this action, we recommend selecting the records in smaller batches.</p>
<p>Meetings may be exported from the Meetings list view by selecting "Export" from the Actions menu.

            <p>Outgoing mail servers are what allow users to send email through Sugar. Sugar allows users to configure multiple outgoing mail servers to send email from. Users have the ability to use the system's outgoing mail server with their own user name and password. If Sugar is not configured with a system outbound account, users may create a personal inbound account to pair with their personal outbound account in order to send emails.<br />Administrators also have the ability to allow users to use the system user name and password configured in Admin &gt; Email Settings. For more information on how to configure the system outgoing mail server, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/06_Email#Outgoing_Mail_Configuration">Email</a> documentation in the administration guide.<br />If the Sugar administrator has disabled the ability to use the system account for outgoing email, then users will need to enter their user name and password for the mail server in their user profile. For more information on how to enter credentials for the system mail server through the user profile, please refer to the <a href="#e-543f-551b22c2c01c___Email_Settings">Getting Started</a> documentation.<br />Use the following steps to add a new outgoing mail account from the Emails module:</p>

To access these options while composing an email, simply click "Options" towards the top of the page.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/494fcd58-163a-10c4-6f33-5503050f9cba.png" alt="" width="323" height="133" /><br />This opens the Options pane on the right side of the page.</p>
    <h4 id="e06b545-5f8a-348a-a1db-556e3f1b53ba_Using_a_Template">Using a Template</h4>
    <p>Email templates allow users to create an email based off of a predetermined template. This can reduce typing errors and save time by having common emails prepared into a template. For more information on how to create or modify an email template, please refer to the <a href="#e06b545-5f8a-348a-a1db-556e3f1b53ba_Email_Templates">Email Templates</a> section in this documentation.<br />Use the following steps to utilize a template while composing an email.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>From the Options pane, select a template to use.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/44245ef5-56d4-c014-e1da-550305f2393d.png" alt="" width="215" height="264" /></li>
        <li>Anything currently written in the body or subject of the email you are currently composing will be removed and replaced with the template data.</li>
        <li>If the selected template has any variable fields defined in it (i.e. $contact_name) then when Sugar sends the email it will replace these variable placeholders with values from the associated record. If no associated record is found, the variable placeholders will be replaced with an empty string.<br /><strong>Note</strong> : If multiple records share the same email address or multiple recipients are on the email, Sugar will pick one of the record's values to place in the email template to send to all of the email addresses. This can provide undesired results. For more information on how to send a dynamic variable to many recipients, please refer to the <a href="#e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Campaign_Types">Campaigns</a> documentation in the Application guide.</li>

    <h4 id="e06b545-5f8a-348a-a1db-556e3f1b53ba_Using_a_Signature">Using a Signature</h4>
    <p>Sugar allows you to create multiple signatures to use when composing email. For more information on how to create or edit signatures, please refer to the <a href="#e06b545-5f8a-348a-a1db-556e3f1b53ba_General_Settings">General Settings</a> section in this document.</p>
    <p>Use the following steps to add a signature while composing an email.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>From the Options pane, select a signature to use.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/646b0dba-40a0-dccb-703e-5503053448aa.png" alt="" width="185" height="264" /></li>
        <li>Depending on your settings, the Signature will appear below or above any content in the body of the email.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4 id="e06b545-5f8a-348a-a1db-556e3f1b53ba_Setting_Teams">Setting Teams</h4>
    <p>By default, Sugar assigns any composed email to your default teams as specified in your user profile. For more information on how to change your default team, please refer to the <a href="#e-543f-551b22c2c01c_Advanced_Tab">Getting Started</a> documentation. When composing an email you can change or add teams to the email before sending.<br />Use the following steps to add or remove teams from an email while composing the email:</p>

    </ol>
    <h4 id="e06b545-5f8a-348a-a1db-556e3f1b53ba_Sending_in_Plain_Text">Sending in Plain Text</h4>
    <p>By default, Sugar sends email as HTML content. Some email clients can not render HTML content, but prefer email sent as plain text. If there are no images, links, or formatting in your email, then sending it as plain text may be a good option.<br />To send an email as plain text, simply click "Send in Plain Text" from the Options pane.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/c05f5eeb-b267-08f8-d78f-55030527e202.png" alt="" width="184" height="257" /><br /><strong>Note</strong> : TinyMCE is removed from the compose screen when selecting this option since plain text emails contain no formatting.</p>
    <h3 id="e06b545-5f8a-348a-a1db-556e3f1b53ba_Relating_to_Records">Relating to Records</h3>
    <p>Emails in Sugar are implicitly related to records in Sugar that match an email address in the From, To, or Cc fields in the email. This implicit relationship is made for emails sent from Sugar as well as any email imported into Sugar via Inbound email accounts or email archiving. Any emails that contain the implicit relationship will show in the History subpanel of the related record.<br />While composing an email, users have the ability to set an explicit relationship via the flex relate field. This allows the new email to be related to a single record from one of many modules.<br />Use the following steps to set the Related To field while composing an email:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select a module from the Related To dropdown.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8bc432fa-4843-839d-18ad-55030593664d.png" alt="" width="462" height="224" /></li>
        <li>In the field next to the dropdown, you can begin typing the name of the record for the specified module. The type ahead feature will show you any results fro mthat module that match what you have typed.</li>
        <li>Alternatively, you can select the arrow icon to open up a search window for the selected module.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/bf45539a-74f2-c401-60c4-55030585e2c5.png" alt="" width="342" height="51" /></li>
        <li>Use the search window to locate and select the desired record to relate to the email.</li>
        <li>This email will now show in the History subpanel of the selected record.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>To modify the flex relate for an email, right click on it in the emails module and select "Relate".<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/79b3af99-d64d-f6c9-8b71-550305ef1006.png" alt="" width="404" height="211" /><br />The flex relate field is not the only way to relate an email to records within Sugar. Emails can also be related directly to one or more Accounts, Contacts, and more.<br />Use the following steps to relate an email to other records in Sugar:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>From the emails module, right click on an email and select "View Relationships"<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b25e49e5-dcdc-1bf7-80ab-550305ded330.png" alt="" width="559" height="117" /></li>
        <li>This will show the detail view of the selected email with subpanels to multiple modules below the email content.</li>
        <li>Click "Create" or "Select" from a subpanels action menu to either create a new record or select and existing one to relate to this email.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e58a4b06-81f4-4007-99f0-550305d2d194.png" alt="" height="100" width="161" /></li>
        <li>Relating a record to an email this way will also force this email to show up in the related record's history subpanel.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Beneath an email record's fields are subpanels containing related records from various modules, attachments, and the email's activities.</p>
    <h4 id="e06b545-5f8a-348a-a1db-556e3f1b53ba_Related_Record_Subpanels">Related Record Subpanels</h4>
    <p>The most common type of subpanels displayed on a email's detail view contain the email's related records belonging to various modules. The relationship type determines whether a related record will be displayed in the field listing or in a subpanel. For example, an email may be related to only one task via the flex relate but related to multiple opportunities. This means that the related task will be displayed amongst the email's fields while opportunities will be displayed in a subpanel beneath the fields.<br />Related record subpanels allow the following operations to be performed. Please note that administrators in Sugar can change the subpanel's Action menu to be displayed as separate buttons instead of a dropdown via Admin &gt; System Settings. For more information, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/05_System#User_Interface">System</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To view the details of a related record, click the record's name in the subpanel to open it in detail view.</li>
        <li>To relate an existing record to the email, choose "Select" from the subpanel's Action menu, then locate and select the desired record.</li>
        <li>To relate a new record to the email, choose "Create" from the subpanel's Action menu, then complete the Quick Create form and click "Save".</li>
        <li>To edit a related record, choose "Edit" on the far right of the record's row.</li>
        <li>To delete the email's relationship to a record, choose "Unlink" from the dropdown on the far right of the record's row. This removes the relationship, but does not delete the record itself.</li>
        <li>To collapse or expand the subpanel, click the double arrow to the left of the subpanel's name.</li>

    <p>Sugar includes the standard "Reply" and "Reply All" functions that are included in most email clients. When replying to an email, Sugar composes a new email while populating the body, subject, and recipients of the email.

    <h2 id="e06b545-5f8a-348a-a1db-556e3f1b53ba_Deleting_Emails">Deleting Emails</h2>
    <p>If a email is invalid or should no longer appear in your organization's Sugar instance, it may be deleted from either the Emails detail view or Emails Module. Deleting via the detail view allows you to delete a single record while the module view allows for mass deleting multiple records at once. Deleting email records will not delete the related records and will only remove the relationship, so you may wish to also delete any related records to avoid orphaned records.<br />Please note that your ability to delete emails may be restricted by a role. For more information on roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide.

    <h2 id="e06b545-5f8a-348a-a1db-556e3f1b53ba_Email_Templates">Email Templates</h2>
    <p>Email templates are used in Sugar as simple form letters, automated email responses, or just commonly used emails to save time and prevent typos. When a user receives an email regarding a case or bug, then can send back a standard response email using an email template. Email templates are also used for campaigns within Sugar as well as workflows. For more information on how to create and modify email templates for campaigns, please refer to the <a href="#e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Creating_Email_Templates">Creating Email Templates</a> section in the Campaigns documentation.

    <h2 id="e06b545-5f8a-348a-a1db-556e3f1b53ba_Sugar_Email_Archiving">Sugar Email Archiving</h2>
    <p>Sugar Email Archiving is an automatic email importing service that allows users to import emails into Sugar by sending them from any mail client or service to a Sugar-provided email address. Each Sugar instance has its own unique Sugar Email Archiving mailbox. To import emails, a user sends or forwards emails to the unique Sugar Email Archiving email address using the To, Cc, or Bcc fields. The Sugar Email Archiving service will import the email into the Sugar instance. The service imports the email, along with any attachments, images, and calendar events, then creates records within the application that are associated with existing records by matching email addresses in the To and Cc fields. In addition, the Sugar Email Archiving service will also scan the body of the email to archive the email to records with a matching email address. Please note that in order for the email address to be recognized properly for email archiving, it must be displayed as "To: (End Client Name (optional)) " (e.g. To: John Smith john@example.com&gt;) in the body of the email. The archived email will appear in the History dashlet for any matching records in Sugar. The imported emails will also be related to a specified case number by including the case macro and the case number (i.e. [CASE:{number}]) in the subject of the email.</p>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Email Archiving cannot read email addresses from the Bcc field the same as when you receive an email.<br />Emails can be sent to the Sugar Email Archiving address and viewed in the History dashlets in Record View pages for the following modules:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Accounts</li>
        <li>Contacts</li>
        <li>Leads</li>
        <li>Opportunities</li>
        <li>Cases</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Emails with .ics meeting attachments sent to SNIP are parsed by Sugar. The Meeting record is created and for every email that is invited to the meeting, if User, Contact or Lead record exists matching this email, this record is added to the list of invitees for the meeting. </p>
    <p>Email Archiving can be configured via Admin &gt; Email Archiving. For more information on how to setup and configure Email Archiving, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/06_Email#Email_Archiving">Email</a> documentation in the administration guide.</p>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: If the email client is configured to use non-English From, To, and Cc fields, forwarding emails inline to Email Archiving may not work. Send the email to Email Archiving directly using the Cc and Bcc fields or forward the email as an attachment. For large volume of non-English emails that need to be archived using Email Archiving, set a rule in your email application to copy the emails to the SNIP email address. </p>

<h1 id="ba-badd-38a2-b0f4-551b228a3370_Tasks">Tasks</h1>
<h2 id="ba-badd-38a2-b0f4-551b228a3370_Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Sugar's Tasks module consists of flexible actions, to-do items, or other types of activity which requires completion. Task records can be related to one record in most modules via the flex relate field and can also be related to a single Contact. There are various ways you can create tasks in Sugar such as via the Tasks module, duplication, importing tasks, etc. Once the task record is created, you can view and edit information pertaining to the task via the Tasks record view. Depending on the details on the task, you may also be able to view and edit the task information via the Calendar module. Each task record may then relate to other Sugar records such as accounts, contacts, opportunities, and many others. This documentation will cover how to use the Tasks module as well as the various actions and options available from within the module.</p>
<h2 id="ba-badd-38a2-b0f4-551b228a3370_Task_Fields">Task Fields</h2>
<p>The Tasks module contains a number of stock fields which come out-of-the-box with Sugar. The below definitions are suggested meanings for the fields, but the fields can be leveraged differently to best meet your organization's needs. Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to alter, add, or remove fields via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on configuring fields, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Fields">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

<h2 id="ba-badd-38a2-b0f4-551b228a3370_Searching_Tasks">Searching Tasks</h2>
<p>The Tasks list view includes a module search to help you locate records easily and effectively in a module-specific manner. Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Tasks list view below. Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Please note that Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %schedule). This will pull up any record that has the word "schedule" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p>
<p>For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/03_Search#List_View_Search_%28Sidecar_Modules%29">Search</a> documentation.</p>
<h3 id="ba-badd-38a2-b0f4-551b228a3370_Module_Search">Module Search</h3>
<p>Module search enables users to easily search by task name within the Tasks module and pull up matching records in the list view. The search also provides a Filter option which can be used in combination with the open Search box to narrow your search further using the available options as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Create </strong>: Create a new custom filter which you can use to filter your search
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Note</strong>: You can also click "Create" to the right of the Filter option.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>All Tasks</strong> : Returns all records in the module to which you have access</li>
    <li><strong>My Favorites</strong> : Returns only records you have marked as favorites</li>
    <li><strong>My Tasks</strong> : Returns only records assigned to you</li>
    <li><strong>Recently Created </strong>: Returns only records you created in the module within the last 7 days</li>
    <li><strong>Recently Viewed </strong>: Returns only records you have viewed within the last 7 days</li>
</ul>

<p>When you choose a filter, Sugar will return tasks which match both the selected filter and any name provided in the "Search by subject..." bar in the filtered list view results. For example, if you select "My Tasks" in the Filter options and enter a task name, Sugar will only return task records with a matching name that are assigned to you. Once the search is complete, the relevant results will populate in the <a href="#ba-badd-38a2-b0f4-551b228a3370_Tasks_List_View">list view</a> below the search bar. To see all task records to which you have access, simply select the All Tasks option in the filter and remove any text from the search bar. You can also click the Clear icon within the selected filter option (e.g. My Tasks) in the Search bar to clear the filter and pull up all list view search results. When you run a search using a saved or created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/6dca08f4-762b-18be-f585-550302fbe9b9.png" alt="" width="286" height="167" /></p>
<p>Please note that you will only be able to see task records as allowed by your team membership, user access type, and assigned roles. For more information on teams and roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/031_Team_Management">Team Management</a> and <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide. Administrators can configure what fields appear on the Tasks Module Search via Admin &gt; Studio.

<h4 id="ba-badd-38a2-b0f4-551b228a3370_Creating_a_Filter">Creating a Filter</h4>
<p>Users can also create new filters via the Create option in the Filter list of the search bar. This allows users to add custom, complex filter options when searching in the Tasks list view. You have the option to add multiple fields to your new filter by clicking the Plus button to the right of the filter selection dropdown lists and set select operators along with their value(s). A filter's criteria need to be true for a record in order for it to appear in the list view search result. Additionally, filters with no specified values may be saved as a custom filter to act as a filter template when a user often searches using the same fields but with varying values. Please note that only fields you have view access for will appear in the Filter list when creating a search filter.</p>
<p>When you run a search using a created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away.</p>
<p>The following steps cover creating a new Assigned to filter as an example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click the Filter option on the Tasks search bar then select "Create".
        <ul>
            <li>You can also click "Create" to the right of the Filter option.</li>
        </ul><br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/129c2fbd-39e0-6cd1-e6dd-550302a7fc62.png" alt="" width="327" height="269" /></li>
    <li>Select the field you wish to add to your filter as well as the condition and matching criteria.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Note</strong>: Only fields you have view access for will be available to add in the Filter list.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>To add additional fields to the new filter, click the Plus button to the right of the filter.
        <ul>
            <li>To remove fields from the new filter, click the Minus button to the right of the filter.</li>
            <li>To clear any filter values (e.g. Will Westin), simply click the "x" to the right of the value or select "Reset" to the left of the Save button.</li>
        </ul><br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/50297231-879d-728b-3578-55030235cb2f.png" alt="" width="551" height="299" /></li>
</ol>
<p>The list view will automatically display results matching your filters as you create and modify the criteria.</p>
<h4 id="ba-badd-38a2-b0f4-551b228a3370_Saving_a_Filter">Saving a Filter</h4>
<p>Saving a filter will preserve the chosen fields as well as the condition(s) of the matching value(s). Additionally, it will allow users to easily select previously created and saved filters from the Filter options.</p>
<p>The following steps cover saving a new search by Name filter as an example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Create a <a href="#ba-badd-38a2-b0f4-551b228a3370_Creating_a_Filter">new filter</a> to perform a search on your desired fields.</li>
    <li>Enter in a name for the new filter (e.g. "Tasks not assigned to Will"). <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/bb90c5cc-57c2-40b4-87b2-5503023ed216.png" alt="" width="590" height="69" /></li>
    <li>Click "Save" to add this filter to the module's Filter options.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="ba-badd-38a2-b0f4-551b228a3370_Global_Search">Global Search</h3>
<p>Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Beginning with version 6.5.0, Full Text Search is used with Global Search to search throughout nearly all fields and modules for an enhanced search experience. The Global Search bar is located on the top right hand side of Sugar. You can click the magnifying glass icon or hit Return/Enter to perform your search once the text string is entered in the search box.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/c3a70d97-a184-6039-9c7a-55030231fa64.png" alt="" height="43" width="334" /></p>
<p>To use global search, you need to first enter the keyword into the search box and the pop-up results will begin appearing once you enter in at least one character. Clicking the magnifying glass icon or hitting your Return/Enter key will cause Sugar to return exact matches for your keyword rather than matches with words beginning with your keyword. For more information on using and configuring Global Search, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Global_Search">Global Search</a> section of the Search documentation.</p>
<p>Regular Sugar users can configure some aspects of global search such as what modules are displayed in the search results by clicking the down arrow within the search box then selecting the module(s) to include in the search. For more information on configuring your Global Search, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Advanced_Options">Search</a> documentation. Administrators can control additional elements of global search via Admin &gt; Search and Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on administrator configuration of Global Search, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Field_Options">Field Options</a> section of the Studio documentation as well as the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/05_System#Search">Search</a> section of the System documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<h2 id="ba-badd-38a2-b0f4-551b228a3370_Tasks_List_View">Tasks List View</h2>
<p>The Tasks list view displays all task records meeting the current search criteria and to which your user has access. You can view the basic details of each task within the field columns. Please note that you will only be able to see task records as allowed by your team membership, user access type, and assigned roles. For more information on teams and roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/031_Team_Management">Team Management</a> and <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<p>When viewing the Tasks list view, the due date will be highlighted in one of two colors: blue or red. This allows users to quickly view scheduled tasks that are either overdue or due within the next 24 hours. Please note that the due date will not be highlighted for tasks with a status of "Completed" or with a due date in the future (beyond 24 hours from current date and time).</p>
<p>The due dates in the Tasks list view are highlighted as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Blue</strong> : The task is open, and the due date occurs within the next 24 hours.</li>
    <li><strong>Red</strong> : The task is open, and the due date has passed.</li>

<h3 id="ba-badd-38a2-b0f4-551b228a3370_Subpanels">Subpanels</h3>
<p>Beneath a task record's fields are subpanels containing related records from various modules as well as any related notes for the task. Selecting the Data View button will display the subpanels rather than the record's activity stream. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/6a748670-5b81-2878-f4e3-55030272a0c2.png" alt="" height="185" width="567" /></p>
<h4 id="ba-badd-38a2-b0f4-551b228a3370_Filter_Options">Filter Options</h4>
<p>While in Data View, all of the task record's related records will be displayed beneath the task record's fields. Users have the ability to search for records which appear in the subpanels as well as filter the view to only display a specific module (e.g. Notes). To locate a record by name, enter the keyword into the Search bar, and the subpanel(s) with the matching record(s) will appear below. To filter, simply click the Related option to the far left of the Search bar and select the module whose subpanel you wish to view. Filter and search may be combined to only display matching records within a selected module. To see all subpanels to which you have access, simply select "All" in the Related options and remove any text from the search bar. When you run a search using a saved or created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the page. Returning to the page will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5f8ec804-a294-0106-46d0-550302c5388e.png" alt="" width="564" height="148" /><br />When a Sidecar module (e.g. Notes) is selected from the Related options, you have the option to filter the related subpanels further using one of the available options (e.g. My Favorites, Recently Created, etc.). Please note that you can also create custom filters for related Sidecar modules. Once the related module (e.g. Notes) is selected, either click the Filter option and select "Create" or click "Create" to the right of the Filter option. For more information on creating a related records filter, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Creating_a_Related_Records_Filter">Creating a Related Records Filter</a> section of the Search documentation.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/26ac475c-eb45-9434-5f05-5503027775b6.png" alt="" width="699" height="237" /></p>
<h4 id="ba-badd-38a2-b0f4-551b228a3370_Reordering_Subpanels">Reordering Subpanels</h4>
<p>Users can easily move subpanels to a new location on the record view by dragging and dropping the subpanel's header. The new subpanel order will remain for a user upon subsequent visits to the module until the user's browser cache is cleared.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: By default, the only related module to the Tasks module is "Notes". Administrators can create new relationships between various modules in Sugar to create additional subpanels. For more information on creating relationships, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio/#Relationships">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<h4 id="ba-badd-38a2-b0f4-551b228a3370_Related_Record_Subpanels">Related Record Subpanels</h4>
<p>The types of subpanels displayed on a task's detail view contain the tasks related records belonging to various modules. The relationship type determines whether a related record will be displayed in the field listing or in a subpanel. For example, a task may be related to only one contact but related to multiple notes. This means that the related contact will be displayed amongst the task's fields while notes will be displayed in a subpanel beneath the fields.</p>
<p>Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to change the fields (e.g. Name, Assigned User, etc.) and labels of each subpanel by configuring the layout via Admin &gt; Studio to provide visibility to the most important fields. For more information on modifying subpanels, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Editing_Subpanels">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<p>Related record subpanels allow the following operations to be performed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To view the details of a related record, click the record's name in the subpanel to open it in record view.</li>
    <li>To relate an existing record to the task, choose "Link Existing Record" from the subpanel's Action menu, then locate and select the desired record.</li>
    <li>To relate a new record to the task, click the Plus button to the left of the Actions menu, then complete the record view layout and click "Save".</li>
    <li>To preview the related record, click the Preview icon to the far right of the record's row in the subpanel.</li>
    <li>To inline edit the record directly from the subpanel, choose "Edit" from the Actions menu on the far right of the record's row and click "Save" to preserve the change.</li>
    <li>To delete the task's relationship to a record, choose "Unlink" from the Actions menu on the far right of the record's row. This removes the relationship, but does not delete the record itself.</li>
    <li>To mark the record as a favorite, click the star icon to the left of the desired record's row.</li>
    <li>To collapse or expand the subpanel, click the Up arrow to the left of the Plus button.</li>
    <li>To change the column size in the subpanel, place your cursor on the column divider and when the Left and Right arrow appears, click and drag the column to the desired size. Please note that the column width will not be preserved when you navigate away from the page.</li>

<h2 id="ba-badd-38a2-b0f4-551b228a3370_Deleting_Tasks">Deleting Tasks</h2>
<p>If a task record is invalid or should no longer appear in your organization's Sugar instance, it may be deleted from either the Tasks record view or list view. Deleting via the record view allows you to delete a single record while the list view allows for mass deleting multiple records at once as well as single record deletions. Deleting task records will not delete the related records and will only remove the relationship, so you may wish to also delete any related records to avoid orphaned records. <br />Please note that your ability to delete tasks in Sugar may be restricted by a role. For more information on roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide. Check with your system administrator if you do not see the Delete options.</p>

<h2 id="ba-badd-38a2-b0f4-551b228a3370_Exporting_Tasks">Exporting Tasks</h2>
<p>Sugar's Export option allows users to download all fields for the selected tasks to their computers as a .CSV (comma-separated values) file. This may be useful when needing to use task data with other software such as Microsoft Excel or to update existing records by exporting, making changes, then importing the altered tasks back into Sugar. For more information on updating existing records via import, please refer to the <a href="#f-87f1-f338-50da-551b227d034a_Importing_Updates_to_Existing_Records">Import</a> documentation. Due to PHP memory limitations on the server, there may be occasions when the application times out while exporting a large number of tasks records. If you encounter an error when performing this action, we recommend selecting the records in smaller batches. <br />Tasks may be exported from the Tasks list view by selecting "Export" from the Actions menu. Users with access to the Reports module also have the option of creating or accessing reports containing specifically chosen fields for tasks and their related record(s). Please note that only Rows and Columns-type reports have the ability to be exported.

<p>When duplicate records are identified in Sugar, you have the option to merge two or more tasks into a single record. Once the merge is complete, the duplicate task record(s) will be deleted, and the primary record will remain. Please note that all relationships belonging to the duplicate tasks will be merged to the primary record meaning that any notes related to the duplicate task record(s) will automatically be related to the resulting, merged task record.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Date Created, Date Modified, and Password field types are not supported when merging duplicate records in Sugar.</p>

    <li>Select "Merge" from the Actions menu to display the Merging Records page. The primary record's field values are displayed on the left while other record's values are in columns to the right. For convenience, fields with differing values will appear on the top of the list. Saving the merge will preserve only the field values marked with the radio button into a single record. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/92fe086d-1093-807e-b9aa-5503029e0069.png" alt="" width="650" height="258" />
        <p>If three or more records are selected to be merged, an X icon will appear at the top right of each record. Clicking the "X" will remove the record from the merge process but will not delete the record.</p>

<h2 id="d706ba-5a49-27d4-53ac-551b22e7be1b_Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The Notes module consists of individual notes that contain text or an attachment pertinent to the related record. Note records can be related to one record in most modules via the flex relate field and can also be related to a single Contact. Notes can hold generic text about a record or even an attachment related to the record. There are various ways you can create notes in Sugar such as via the Notes module, importing notes, via History subpanels, etc. Once the note record is created, you can view and edit information pertaining to the note via the Notes record view. Each note record may then relate to other Sugar records such as accounts, contacts, opportunities, and many others. This documentation will cover how to use the Notes module as well as the various actions and options available from within the module.</p>
<h2 id="d706ba-5a49-27d4-53ac-551b22e7be1b_Note_Fields">Note Fields</h2>
<p>The Notes module contains a number of stock fields which come out-of-the-box with Sugar. The below definitions are suggested meanings for the fields, but the fields can be leveraged differently to best meet your organization's needs. Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to alter, add, or remove fields via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on configuring fields, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Fields">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

<h2 id="d706ba-5a49-27d4-53ac-551b22e7be1b_Creating_Notes_and_Attachments">Creating Notes and Attachments</h2>
<p>There are various methods for creating notes in Sugar including via the Notes module, quick create, duplication, importing notes, and via the history subpanel. The full record view layout opens when creating the note directly from the Notes menu and includes all of the relevant fields for your organization's notes. The quick create form is a shortened version of the notes record view and typically contains fewer fields. When using quick create to make a note while viewing an existing record of another module, Sugar automatically creates a relationship between both records. For example, if you are viewing an account record (e.g. ABC Company) and create a new note via the quick create form, the Account module is selected and the Related to will automatically populate with "ABC Company", thus creating the relationship. Both the Record View and Quick Create layouts can be configured by administrators via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on configuring layouts, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Layouts">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

    <p>Users with access to the Reports module can build, run, and manage reports to gather key data regarding notes and their related records. In addition to only displaying desired fields and relationships, reports can also incorporate complex filters to only display specific subsets of your records. Once the report is run, you will be able to view the note record's record view by clicking the note's subject in the report results. Please note that you can only directly access note record views with Rows and Columns-type and Summation with Records-type reports as Summation-type and Matrix-type reports do not include hyperlinks in their display columns. For more information on using reports, please refer to the <a href="#d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Reports_Detail_View">Reports</a> documentation.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/7ea202ea-09e4-cd49-bdfe-550306b2f367.png" alt="" width="550" height="283" /></p>
    <p>Please note that your ability to access reports may be restricted by a role.

    <h2 id="d706ba-5a49-27d4-53ac-551b22e7be1b_Searching_Notes">Searching Notes</h2>
    <p>The Notes list view includes a Module Search to help you locate records easily and effectively in a module-specific manner. Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Notes list view below. Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Please note that Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %services). This will pull up any record that has the word "services" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends. <br />For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/03_Search#List_View_Search_%28Sidecar_Modules%29">Search</a> documentation.</p>
    <h3 id="d706ba-5a49-27d4-53ac-551b22e7be1b_Module_Search">Module Search</h3>
    <p>Module search enables users to easily search by note subject within the Notes module and pull up matching records in the list view. The search also provides a Filter option which can be used in combination with the open Search box to narrow your search further using the available options as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Create</strong> : Create a new custom filter which you can use to filter your search
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Note</strong>: You can also click "Create" to the right of the Filter option.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>All Notes</strong> : Returns all records in the module to which you have access</li>
        <li><strong>Created by Me </strong>:Returns all records in the module created by you</li>
        <li><strong>My Favorites : </strong>Returns only records you have marked as favorites</li>
        <li><strong>My Notes </strong>: Returns only records assigned to you</li>
        <li><strong>Recently Created</strong> : Returns only records you created in the module within the last 7 days</li>
        <li><strong>Recently Viewed </strong>: Returns only records you have viewed in the module within the last 7 days<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/348112b6-378e-ba7a-0574-550306c786d5.png" alt="" height="319" width="450" /></li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you choose a filter, Sugar will return notes which match both the selected filter and any subject provided in the "Search by subject..." bar in the filtered list view results. For example, if you select "My Notes" in the Filter options and enter a subject name, Sugar will only return subject records with a matching subject that are assigned to you. Once the search is complete, the relevant results will populate in the <a href="#d706ba-5a49-27d4-53ac-551b22e7be1b_Notes_List_View">list view</a> below the search bar. To see all note records to which you have access, simply select the All Notes option in the filter and remove any text from the search bar. You can also click the Clear icon within the selected filter option (e.g. My Notes) in the Search bar to clear the filter and pull up all list view search results. When you run a search using a saved or created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/efb47e69-d6ad-67f1-16fc-550306222013.png" alt="" height="219" width="355" /></p>
    <p>Please note that you will only be able to see note records as allowed by your team membership, user access type, and assigned roles.

    <p>Users can also create new filters via the Create option in the Filter list of the search bar. This allows users to add custom, complex filter options when searching in the Notes list view. You have the option to add multiple fields to your new filter by clicking the Plus button to the right of the filter selection dropdown lists. Please note that each one of the filter's criteria need to be true for a record in order for it to appear in the list view search result. When you run a search using a created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away.</p>

        <li>To add additional fields to the new filter, click the Plus button to the right of the filter.
            <ul>
                <li>To remove fields from the new filter, click the Minus button to the right of the filter.</li>
                <li>To clear any filter values (e.g. last 30 days), simply click the "x" to the right of the value (if applicable) or select "Reset" to the left of the Save button<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/809f2e0c-2b52-22da-727e-550306fd1501.png" alt="" height="253" width="446" /></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The list view will automatically display results matching your filters as you create and modify the criteria.</p>
    <h4 id="d706ba-5a49-27d4-53ac-551b22e7be1b_Saving_a_Filter">Saving a Filter</h4>

    <p>Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Beginning with version 6.5.0, Full Text Search may be used with Global Search to search throughout nearly all fields and modules for an enhanced search experience. The Global Search bar is located on the top right hand side of Sugar. You can click the magnifying glass icon or hit Return/Enter to perform your search once the text string is entered in the search box. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/3584afb4-a3c0-97f6-4bff-5503067ab314.png" alt="" width="300" height="40" /><br />To use global search, you need to first enter the keyword into the search box and the pop-up results will begin appearing once you enter in at least one character. Clicking the magnifying glass icon or hitting your Return/Enter key will cause Sugar to return exact matches for your keyword rather than matches with words beginning with your keyword. For more information on using and configuring Global Search, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Global_Search">Global Search</a> section of the Search documentation.</p>
    <p>Regular Sugar users can configure some aspects of global search such as what modules are displayed in the search results by clicking the down arrow within the Search box then selecting the module(s) to include in the search. For more information on configuring your Global Search, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Advanced_Options">Search</a> documentation.

<h2 id="e803ec-6b55-3629-41d5-551b22349456_Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Sugar's Targets module consists of individual people who are unqualified prospects that you have some information on, but is not yet a qualified lead. Information (e.g. name, email address) regarding these targets are normally acquired from business cards you receive while attending various trades shows, conferences, etc. Targets in Sugar are stand-alone records as they are not related to contacts, leads, accounts, or opportunities. There are various ways you can create targets in Sugar such as via the Targets module, importing targets, etc. Once the target record is created, you can view and edit information pertaining to the target via the Targets Record view. This documentation will cover the basics of the Targets module as well as the various options available in performing the actions related to the module.</p>
<h2 id="e803ec-6b55-3629-41d5-551b22349456_Target_Fields">Target Fields</h2>
<p>The Targets module contains a number of stock fields which come out-of-the-box with Sugar. The below definitions are suggested meanings for the fields, but the fields can be leveraged differently to best meet your organization's needs. Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to alter, add, or remove fields via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on configuring fields, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Fields">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

<h2 id="e803ec-6b55-3629-41d5-551b22349456_Creating_Targets">Creating Targets</h2>
<p>There are various methods for creating targets in Sugar including via the Targets module, quick create, duplication, and importing targets. The full record view layout opens when creating the target directly from the Targets menu and includes all of the relevant fields for your organization's targets. The quick create form is a shortened version of the targets record view and typically contains fewer fields. Both the Record View and Quick Create layouts can be configured by administrators via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on configuring layouts, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Layouts">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

<h2 id="e803ec-6b55-3629-41d5-551b22349456_Searching_Targets">Searching Targets</h2>
<p>The Targets list view includes a module search to help you locate records easily and effectively in a module-specific manner. Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Targets list view below. Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Please note that Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %smith). This will pull up any record that has the word "smith" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p>
<p>For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Search">Search</a> documentation.</p>
<h3 id="e803ec-6b55-3629-41d5-551b22349456_Module_Search">Module Search</h3>
<p>Module search enables users to easily search by target name within the Targets module and pull up matching records in the list view. Records are deemed as matching when their first or last names start with any of the terms entered in the open Search box. The search also provides a Filter option which can be used in combination with the open Search box to narrow your search further using the available options as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Create</strong> : Create a new custom filter which you can use to filter your search
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Note</strong>: You can also click "Create" to the right of the Filter option.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>All Targets</strong> : Returns all records in the module to which you have access</li>
    <li><strong>My Favorites</strong> : Returns only records you have marked as favorites</li>
    <li><strong>My Targets </strong>: Returns only records assigned to you</li>
    <li><strong>Recently Created </strong>: Returns only records you created in the module within the last 7 days</li>
    <li><strong>Recently Viewed </strong>: Returns only records you have viewed in the module within the last 7 days</li>
</ul>

<p>When you choose a filter, Sugar will return targets which match both the selected filter and any name provided in the "Search by first name, last name..." bar in the filtered list view results. For example, if you select "My Targets" in the Filter options and enter a target name, Sugar will only return target records with a matching name that are assigned to you. Once the search is complete, the relevant results will populate in the <a href="#e803ec-6b55-3629-41d5-551b22349456_Targets_List_View">list view</a> below the search bar. To see all target records to which you have access, simply select the All Targets option in the filter and remove any text from the search bar. You can also click the Clear icon within the selected filter option (e.g. My Targets) in the Search bar to clear the filter and pull up all list view search results. When you run a search using a saved or created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a9c8ca53-c034-e43b-b6af-550309cba88d.png" alt="" height="167" width="342" /></p>
<p>Please note that you will only be able to see target records as allowed by your team membership, user access type, and assigned roles. For more information on teams and roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/031_Team_Management">Team Management</a> and <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide.

<p>Users can also create new filters via the Create option in the Filter list of the search bar. This allows users to add custom, complex filter options when searching in the Targets list view. You have the option to add multiple fields to your new filter by clicking the Plus button to the right of the filter selection dropdown lists and set select operators along with their value(s). A filter's criteria need to be true for a record in order for it to appear in the list view search result. Additionally, filters with no specified values may be saved as a custom filter to act as a filter template when a user often searches using the same fields but with varying values. Please note that only fields you have view access for will appear in the Filter list when creating a search filter.</p>
<p>When you run a search using a created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away.</p>
<p>The following steps cover creating a new Assigned to filter as an example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click the Filter option on the Targets search bar then select "Create".

<h3 id="e803ec-6b55-3629-41d5-551b22349456_Global_Search">Global Search</h3>
<p>Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Beginning with version 6.5.0, Full Text Search may be used with Global Search to search throughout nearly all fields and modules for an enhanced search experience. The Global Search bar is located on the top right hand side of Sugar. You can click the magnifying glass icon or hit Return/Enter to perform your search once the text string is entered in the search box.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/9231b168-8a61-9692-b245-550308295ea3.png" alt="" width="300" height="39" /></p>
<p>To use global search, you need to first enter the keyword into the search box and the pop-up results will begin appearing once you enter in at least one character. Clicking the magnifying glass icon or hitting your Return/Enter key will cause Sugar to return exact matches for your keyword rather than matches with words beginning with your keyword. For more information on using and configuring Global Search, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Global_Search">Global Search</a> section of the Search documentation.</p>
<p>Regular Sugar users can configure some aspects of global search such as what modules are displayed in the search results by clicking the down arrow within the Search box then selecting the module(s) to include in the search. For more information on configuring your Global Search, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Advanced_Options">Search</a> documentation. Administrators can control additional elements of global search via Admin &gt; Search and Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on administrator configuration of Global Search, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Field_Options">Field Options</a> section of the Studio documentation as well as the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/05_System#Search">Search</a> section of the System documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

<p>Users have the option to mark target records as a favorite via the record view as well as the list view. This allows users to designate records that are important or will be viewed often as they can easily be accessed via search or from the Targets module tab. In the Target's record view, the star on the right of the target's name is yellow once marked to indicate a favorite target. For more information on how to mark records as favorites, please refer to the <a href="#e803ec-6b55-3629-41d5-551b22349456_Favoriting_Targets">Favoriting Targets</a> section of this documentation. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/99b0c951-d98c-8722-8df6-5503097cf24d.png" alt="" width="200" height="48" /></p>
<h3 id="e803ec-6b55-3629-41d5-551b22349456_Target_Image">Target Image</h3>

<h3 id="e803ec-6b55-3629-41d5-551b22349456_Show_More">Show More</h3>
<p>The Targets record view typically display a few key fields (e.g. website, industry, office phone, etc.) on the business card panel with the option to view more fields by clicking the Show More link on the bottom left. Please note that administrators can configure what fields appear on the business card panel via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on editing layouts, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Layouts">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/1daaba3a-83cd-4bf7-e25b-55030941bdc2.png" alt="" width="450" height="231" /></p>
<h3 id="e803ec-6b55-3629-41d5-551b22349456_Subpanels">Subpanels</h3>
<p>Beneath a target record's fields are subpanels containing related records from various modules and campaign interaction history for this target.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/ef2a7756-330d-567d-ea47-550309a01eea.png" alt="" width="475" height="124" /></p>
<h4 id="e803ec-6b55-3629-41d5-551b22349456_Filter_Options">Filter Options</h4>
<p>While in Data View, all of the target record's related records will be displayed beneath the target record's fields. Users have the ability to search for records which appear in the subpanels as well as filter the view to only display a specific module (e.g. Tasks, Notes, etc.). To locate a record by name, enter the keyword into the Search bar, and the subpanel(s) with the matching record(s) will appear below. To filter, simply click the Related option to the far left of the Search bar and select the module whose subpanel you wish to view. Filter and search may be combined to only display matching records within a selected module. To see all subpanels to which you have access, simply select "All" in the Related options and remove any text from the search bar. When you run a search using a saved or created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the page. Returning to the page will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/38863299-aca7-978f-21dd-5503097c2fae.png" alt="" width="504" height="143" /></p>
<p>When a Sidecar module (e.g. Tasks, Notes, etc.) is selected from the Related options, you have the option to filter the related subpanels further using one of the available options (e.g. My Favorites, Recently Created, etc.). Please note that you can also create custom filters for related Sidecar modules. Once the related module (e.g. Tasks) is selected, either click the Filter option and select "Create" or click "Create" to the right of the Filter option. For more information on creating a related records filter, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Creating_a_Related_Records_Filter">Creating a Related Records Filter</a> section of the Search documentation.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/78295c20-f49c-e7ee-4874-55030990237d.png" alt="" width="569" height="209" /></p>
<h4 id="e803ec-6b55-3629-41d5-551b22349456_Reordering_Subpanels">Reordering Subpanels</h4>
<p>Users can easily move subpanels to a new location on the record view by dragging and dropping the subpanel's header. The new subpanel order will remain for a user upon subsequent visits to the module until the user's browser cache is cleared.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/cbafe0dc-a1d3-06ed-571e-550304afa317.png" alt="Reordering_Subpanels" width="687" height="332" /></p>
<h4 id="e803ec-6b55-3629-41d5-551b22349456_Related_Record_Subpanels">Related Record Subpanels</h4>
<p>The most common type of subpanels displayed on a target's record view contain the target's related records belonging to various modules. The relationship type determines whether a related record will be displayed in the field listing or in a subpanel. For example, a target may be related to multiple notes which means that the related notes will be displayed in a subpanel beneath the fields.</p>
<p>Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to change the fields (e.g. Subject, Status, etc.) and labels of each subpanel by configuring the layout via Admin &gt; Studio to provide visibility to the most important fields. For more information on modifying subpanels, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Editing_Subpanels">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<p>Related record subpanels allow the following operations to be performed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To view the details of a related record, click the record's name in the subpanel to open it in record view.</li>
    <li>To relate an existing record to the target, choose "Link Existing Record" from the subpanel's Action menu, then locate and select the desired record.</li>
    <li>To relate a new record to the target, click the Plus button to the left of the Actions menu, then complete the record view layout and click "Save".</li>

    <li>To inline edit the record directly from the subpanel, choose "Edit" from the Actions menu on the far right of the record's row and click "Save" to preserve the change.</li>
    <li>To delete the target's relationship to a record, choose "Unlink" from the Actions menu on the far right of the record's row. This removes the relationship, but does not delete the record itself.</li>
    <li>To mark the record as a favorite, click the star icon to the left of the desired record's row.</li>
    <li>To collapse or expand the subpanel, click the Up arrow to the left of the Plus button.</li>
    <li>To change the column size in the subpanel, place your cursor on the column divider and when the Left and Right arrow appears, click and drag the column to the desired size. Please note that the column width will not be preserved when you navigate away from the page.</li>

<h4 id="e803ec-6b55-3629-41d5-551b22349456_Emails_Subpanel">Emails Subpanel</h4>
<p>The Emails subpanel in the Targets module displays both emails implicitly and explicitly related to the account record. Emails in Sugar are implicitly related to records in Sugar that match an email address in the From, To, or Cc fields in the email. This implicit relationship is made for emails sent from Sugar as well as any email imported into Sugar via Inbound email accounts or email archiving. While composing an email or relating an existing email to a record, users have the ability to set an explicit relationship via the flex relate field by <a href="#e06b545-5f8a-348a-a1db-556e3f1b53ba_Relating_Emails">Relating Emails</a>. This allows the email to be explicitly related to a single record from one of many modules.</p>
<p>The Emails subpanel allows the following functions to be performed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To view the details of an email, click the subject in the subpanel to open it in detail view.</li>
    <li>Minimize the subpanel by clicking "^" (up arrow).</li>
    <li>Expand the subpanel by clicking "v" (down arrow).</li>
    <li>Click "+" to create a new email that will have an implicit relationship with this record.</li>
    <li>Sort the emails by Subject, Status, Date Created, Date Modified, or Assigned User.</li>
    <li>Click "More emails" to see any additional emails hidden by the default view.</li>
    <li>To change the column size in the subpanel, place your cursor on the column divider, and when the Left and Right arrow appears, click and drag the column to the desired size. For more information on resizing columns, please refer to the <a href="#e803ec-6b55-3629-41d5-551b22349456_Column_Resizing">Column Resizing</a> section of this documentation.

<h4 id="e803ec-6b55-3629-41d5-551b22349456_Campaign_Logs_Subpanel">Campaign Logs Subpanel</h4>
<p>The Campaign Log subpanel contains historical information regarding a target record's interaction with all Sugar campaigns. When a mass marketing campaign is sent to a target (or manually marked as sent in the case of non-email campaigns), the related campaign activity information will appear within the Campaign Logs subpanel. This information mirrors the "View Status" page available from within each individual campaign and shows activities such as when a campaign was sent, when the target viewed the campaign message, when the target clicked a tracked link within the campaign, etc. Since this subpanel contains historical campaign interactions for the target, it cannot be used to associate a target with a campaign or otherwise manage a campaign or target list. For more information on associating a target with a campaign, please refer to the <a href="#e803ec-6b55-3629-41d5-551b22349456_Adding_Targets_to_a_Target_List">Adding Targets to a Target List</a> section of this documentation.For more information on campaigns, please refer to the <a href="#e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Campaigns">Campaigns</a> documentation.</p>
<p>The Campaign Log subpanel allows the following functions to be performed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To view the details of a campaign, click the campaign's name in the subpanel to open it in detail view.</li>
    <li>Sort the campaigns by Campaign Name, Activity Type, Activity Date, or Related.</li>
    <li>To collapse or expand the subpanel, click the Up arrow to the left of the Plus button.</li>
    <li>To load the next set of records in the subpanel, click the More campaign log link on the bottom left of the subpanel.</li>
    <li>To change the column size in the subpanel, place your cursor on the column divider, and when the Left and Right arrow appears, click and drag the column to the desired size.

<p>An intelligence pane displays to the right of the target's record view and provides users with valuable record information via various dashlets. The Help Dashboard normally displays by default along with the Record View Help dashlet and Learning Resources dashlet. The Record View Help dashlet provides users with a brief introduction to the module along with some instructions to help users utilize and navigate around the record view. A link to the corresponding documentation (e.g. Targets documentation) in the Application guide is also provided within the Help dashlet. The Learning Resources dashlet includes links to Sugar University, Community Forums, and Documentation &amp; Support, which provide access to additional resources. Simply click the appropriate link to be directed to the specific page in a separate tab. For more information regarding the Help dashboard, please refer to the <a href="#d03d1-d6ae-25ce-a8e4-551b225ee8d6_Viewing_Via_Record_View">Intelligence Pane</a> documentation. You can access the My Dashboard, which will display some stock dashlets (e.g. Planned Activities dashlet, History dashlet , etc.) by clicking the triangle to the right of "Help Dashboard" and selecting "My Dashboard". Users may choose to view any of their dashboards using the triangle to the right of the current dashboard's name and may create other dashboards for use with the Targets module by clicking the Create button. Selecting "Edit" from the Actions menu on the upper right will allow them to make changes and add additional dashlets to their dashboards.</p>
<p>Users can edit individual dashlets by clicking the Gear icon on the upper right of each dashlet. Dashlets may also be dragged and dropped to rearrange them within the current dashboard. You can collapse dashlets you do not wish to view by clicking the Up arrow on the upper right of the dashlet. Sugar will remember the state of your intelligence pane the next time you return to the Targets module. For more information on editing, creating, and rearranging dashboards and dashlets, please refer to the <a href="#d03d1-d6ae-25ce-a8e4-551b225ee8d6_Intelligence_Pane">Intelligence Pane</a> documentation.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/967757d6-395e-7972-e660-5503092b7172.png" alt="" width="649" height="305" /></p>
<h2 id="e803ec-6b55-3629-41d5-551b22349456_Editing_Targets">Editing Targets</h2>
<p>Targets may be edited at any time to update or add information to the record. You can make changes to existing target records via the Targets record view and quick create forms. Record view is available within the Targets module and includes all of the Target fields you should need. <br />Please note that your ability to edit targets in Sugar may be restricted by a role.

<h2 id="e803ec-6b55-3629-41d5-551b22349456_Deleting_Targets">Deleting Targets</h2>
<p>If a target record is invalid or should no longer appear in your organization's Sugar instance, it may be deleted from either the Target's record view or list view. Deleting via the record view allows you to delete a single record while the list view allows for mass deleting multiple records at once. Deleting target records will not delete the related records and will only remove the relationship, so you may wish to also delete any related records to avoid orphaned records.</p>
<p>Please note that your ability to delete targets in Sugar may be restricted by a role. For more information on roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide.

<p>Sugar enables you to convert targets into leads as you determine they qualify for your organization's definition of a lead (e.g. after an evaluation/qualification process) and becomes a valid sales prospect. Please note that targets are only converted into leads in Sugar, and the new lead record will have a relationship to the original target record. Once the lead is qualified as a sales opportunity, they can be converted into contacts, opportunities, and accounts. For more information on lead conversions, please refer to the <a href="#d26-c435-3cc1-7f4c-551b22d48794_Converting_Leads">Leads</a> documentation.</p>
<h3 id="e803ec-6b55-3629-41d5-551b22349456_Steps_to_Convert_a_Target">Steps to Convert a Target</h3>
<p>Once the target has been evaluated and qualified, they are ready to be converted to a lead in Sugar. <br />The following steps cover converting a target to a lead as an example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to a target's record view.</li>
    <li>Select "Convert Target" from the Actions menu.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/bc4412cd-e7c4-af50-7505-550309414378.png" alt="" width="430" height="170" /></li>
    <li>Enter appropriate values for the fields in the Leads record view layout then click "Save".
        <ul>
            <li>Since targets only convert to a lead, the Leads record view displays all lead fields which are grouped by default into the Overview, More Information, and Other panels. Administrators have the ability to determine what fields are displayed on the Leads record view via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on configuring layouts, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Layouts">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</li>

    <li>Once the conversion is complete, the target record will display the converted lead name at the top of the record view page. You can click the records name to view the detail of the converted lead. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/161ce038-0574-4a81-f0c8-55030942f4c4.png" alt="" width="500" height="84" /></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="e803ec-6b55-3629-41d5-551b22349456_Exporting_Targets">Exporting Targets</h2>
<p>Sugar's Export option allows users to download all fields for the selected targets to their computers as a .CSV (comma-separated values) file. This may be useful when needing to use Target data with other software such as Microsoft Excel or to update existing records by exporting, making changes, then importing the altered targets back into Sugar. For more information on updating existing records via import, please refer to the <a href="#f-87f1-f338-50da-551b227d034a_Importing_Updates_to_Existing_Records">Import</a> documentation. Due to PHP memory limitations on the server, there may be occasions when the application times out while exporting a large number of target records. If you encounter an error when performing this action, we recommend selecting the records in smaller batches.</p>
<p>Targets may be exported from the Targets list view by selecting "Export" from the Actions menu. Users with access to the Reports module also have the option of creating or accessing reports containing specifically chosen fields for targets and their related record(s). Please note that only Rows and Columns-type reports have the ability to be exported.

<h2 id="e803ec-6b55-3629-41d5-551b22349456_Finding_Duplicate_Targets">Finding Duplicate Targets</h2>
<p>Between multiple users working in Sugar, importing new records, and converting leads, it is possible for duplicate target records to be accidentally input to the system. Before creating a new target record, a good practice is to first check that the target does not already exist in Sugar. You can locate duplicate records for cleanup using <a href="#e803ec-6b55-3629-41d5-551b22349456_Module_Search">module search</a> from the Targets list view. Searching for targets with similar names or other information can turn search into a powerful, duplicates-finding tool. Sugar also provides a wizard for finding potential duplicates that is available from the Targets record view and may be used as shown below. If duplicate target records are detected, you can perform a merge per the <a href="#e803ec-6b55-3629-41d5-551b22349456_Merging_Targets">Merging Targets</a> section of this documentation.</p>
<p>Please note that your ability to use the Find Duplicates action may be restricted by any role which prevents target deletion. For more information on roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide. Check with your system administrator if you do not see the Find Duplicates option.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to locate duplicate targets using the Find Duplicates option from the Targets record view:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to a target's record view.</li>
    <li>Choose "Find Duplicates" from the Actions menu. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a829891c-5128-314d-370b-55030986a92e.png" alt="" width="400" height="255" /></li>
    <li>Potential duplicate target records will be listed on the Find Duplicates page. Select the duplicate record(s) you wish to merge then click "Merge Duplicates".
        <ul>
            <li>You can preview the duplicate record's details by clicking the Preview button to the far right of the records row.</li>
            <li>You can search for specific records from the Targets list view if you wish to check for more possible duplicates. For more information on performing a search, please refer to the <a href="#e803ec-6b55-3629-41d5-551b22349456_Module_Search">Module Search</a> section of this documentation.</li>
            <li>You can also click the Column Selection icon above the Preview button to change the list of fields that display on the list view column headers.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Once you click "Merge Duplicates", the merging process with the current record will begin. For instructions on performing the merge that follows, please refer to Steps 3-9 of the <a href="#e803ec-6b55-3629-41d5-551b22349456_Merging_Via_List_View">Merging Via List View</a> section of this documentation.</p>
<h2 id="e803ec-6b55-3629-41d5-551b22349456_Merging_Targets">Merging Targets</h2>
<p>When duplicate records are identified in Sugar, you have the option to merge two or more targets into a single record. Once the merge is complete, the duplicate note record(s) will be deleted, and the primary record will remain. Please note that all relationships belonging to the duplicate targets will be merged to the primary record meaning that any calls, meetings, contacts, etc. related to the duplicate note record(s) will automatically be related to the resulting, merged note record.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Date Created, Date Modified, and Password field types are not supported when merging duplicate records in Sugar.</p>
<h3 id="e803ec-6b55-3629-41d5-551b22349456_Merging_Via_List_View">Merging Via List View</h3>
<p><a href="#e803ec-6b55-3629-41d5-551b22349456_Module_Search">Module Search</a> may be used to identify duplicate targets by, for example, searching for targets with similar names or related targets. Once your search has identified duplicate targets, you can merge them directly from the Targets list view.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to merge targets via the list view:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Use the <a href="#e803ec-6b55-3629-41d5-551b22349456_Module_Search">Module Search</a> to identify duplicate targets.</li>
    <li>Possible duplicates will be displayed in the list view. Select the duplicate record(s) that you wish to merge.
        <ul>
            <li>Please note that up to five records may be merged at once in Sugar. An error message ("Invalid number of records passed. The valid range is from 2 to 5 records.") will appear if more than five records are selected when attempting to perform a merge.</li>
        </ul><br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/9ed8a306-712d-192d-befe-5503092f50c4.png" alt="" width="460" height="216" /></li>
    <li>
        <p>Select "Merge" from the Actions menu to display the Merging Records page. The primary record's field values are displayed on the left while other record's values are in columns to the right. For convenience, fields with differing values will appear on the top of the list. Saving the merge will preserve only the field values marked with the radio button into a single record.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/1baff814-1e9b-9ab8-9672-550309c819b0.png" alt="" width="650" height="183" /></p>
        <p>If 3 or more records are selected to be merged, an X icon will appear at the top right of each record. Clicking the "X" will remove the record from the merge process but will not delete the record.</p>
    </li>
    <li>To change which record is considered the primary, drag and drop the Primary label on the top of a different column.</li>
    <li>Review the field values in each column and click the radio button to the left of the value that should appear on the final record. You can also manually type or select a new value for any field as necessary.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Note</strong>: Fields you do not have Edit access for cannot be edited on the merging records page.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Preview what the final, merged record will contain as you work by clicking the eye icon to display the preview in the Intelligence Pane.</li>
    <li>Click "Save" once all fields you wish to appear on the single, merged record have their radio buttons selected.</li>
    <li>A pop-up message will display confirming that the duplicate record(s) should be deleted. Click "Confirm" to proceed.</li>

<p>The historical summary list view provides the ability to reorder columns by dragging and dropping the title of the column to the desired location. The new column order will remain for a user upon subsequent visits to the module until the user's browser cache is cleared. You can reset the column order back to the default view by clicking the Gear icon to the far right of the list view column headers and selecting "Reset default view". Please note that this option only appears if the current list view column order is different from the system's default column order.</p>
<p>Users can also easily adjust the size of columns in the historical summary list view per their viewing preference. Simply place your cursor on the column divider, and when the Left and Right arrow appears, click and drag the column to the desired size. The set column width will be preserved when you navigate away from the page. Sugar will render the preferred column size across sessions until the user removes or resets the relevant browser cookies. You can reset the column width back to the default size by clicking the Gear icon to the far right of the list view column headers and selecting "Reset default widths". Please note that this option only appears if at least one of the column widths in the Historical Summary list view is different from the default column width.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/815951e7-344b-b0eb-49cc-550309cbbfe1.png" alt="" width="846" height="280" /></p>

<h2 id="d9cb2f7b-b601-60f7-5f90-556f637df06d_Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>A target list consists of a collection of individuals or organizations you want to include or exclude in a mass marketing campaign. Target Lists can contain any number and any combination of Targets, Contacts, Leads, Users, and Accounts. Targets can be grouped into a target list according to a set of predetermined criteria such as age group, geographic location, or spending habits. Target lists are used in mass email marketing campaigns that can be configured in the Campaigns module. For more information regarding creating campaigns, please refer to the <a href="#e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Creating_Campaigns">Campaigns</a> documentation. This documentation will go over the basics of the Target Lists module as well as the various actions and options available from within the module.</p>
<h2 id="d9cb2f7b-b601-60f7-5f90-556f637df06d_Target_Lists_Fields">Target Lists Fields</h2>
<p>The Target Lists module contains a number of stock fields, which come out-of-the-box with Sugar. The below definitions are suggested meanings for the fields, but the fields can be leveraged differently to best meet your organization's needs.</p>

<p>If you do not see the Target Lists module tab in Sugar, please check the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Target Lists module may be marked as hidden in your user preferences, which will prevent it from being displayed. Navigate to your user profile (upper right of Sugar), click the Advanced tab, and check the Layout Options section. If you see the Target Lists module in the Hide Modules list, simply move it to the Display Modules list.

<h2 id="d9cb2f7b-b601-60f7-5f90-556f637df06d_Creating_Target_Lists">Creating Target Lists</h2>
<p>There are various methods for creating target lists in Sugar including via the Target Lists module, duplication, importing of targets, and from the list view of other modules (e.g. Contacts, Accounts, etc.). The full record view layout opens when creating the target lists and includes all of the relevant fields for your organization's target lists.</p>
<h3 id="d9cb2f7b-b601-60f7-5f90-556f637df06d_Creating_Via_Target_Lists_Module">Creating Via Target Lists Module</h3>
<p>One of the most common methods of target list creation is via the Create Target List option in the Target Lists module tab. This opens up the record view layout which allows you to enter in all the relevant information for the target list. <br />Use the following steps to create a target list via the Target Lists module:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click the triangle in the Target Lists module tab to open the actions menu and select "Create Target List". You can also click the Create button on the upper right of the Target Lists list view. <br />From Target Lists module tab: <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/c7d9ff12-4bae-55eb-aacb-550306d1b705.png" alt="" height="83" width="175" /><br />From Target Lists list view: <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/57f08c5a-9968-bce3-a881-550306a95e28.png" alt="" width="468" height="119" /></li>
    <li>Enter appropriate values for the <a href="#d9cb2f7b-b601-60f7-5f90-556f637df06d_Target_Lists_Fields">fields</a> in the record view layout. All required fields will indicate "Required" in the field and must be completed prior to saving.</li>
    <li>Once the necessary information is entered, click "Save".
        <ul>
            <li>Please note that you can also click the Actions Menu to the right of the Save button to select the "Save and view" or "Save and create new" options. Save and view will display the record's details after the save is complete. The Save and create new option saves the current record and opens a new, blank record view in edit mode where the user can create another record</li>
        </ul><br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/f6c60410-acaf-f927-e1db-5503069133b7.png" alt="" width="502" height="109" /></li>
</ol>
<p>You can now add records from the Accounts, Contacts, Leads, Users, and Targets module to your newly created target list. For more information on how to populate a target list, please refer to the <a href="#d9cb2f7b-b601-60f7-5f90-556f637df06d_Populating_Target_Lists">Populating Target Lists</a> section of this documentation.</p>
<p>Please note that you can also create or select an existing target list from a Campaign's record view via the Target List subpanel. This will launch the same record view mentioned above for creating a target list. For more information on how to select a target list from a campaign, please refer to the <a href="#e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Related_Record_Subpanels">Campaigns</a> documentation.</p>
<h3 id="d9cb2f7b-b601-60f7-5f90-556f637df06d_Creating_Via_Duplication">Creating Via Duplication</h3>
<p>You can also create a new target list by duplicating an existing target list record. The Copy option is useful if the target list you are creating has similar information to an existing target list since you have less new data to enter. A major advantage to creating a target list via duplication is that the related records on the original target list will also be related to the newly created target list. <br />Use the following steps to create a target list by duplicating an existing target list record:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to a target list's record view.</li>
    <li>Click the Actions menu and select "Copy". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/80f4aaeb-3f36-60ae-473c-554bd261df71.png" alt="Target Lists Copy7.6" width="432" height="201" /></li>
    <li>The displayed record view is pre-populated with the original target list's values and recipient (Accounts, Leads, Contacts, Targets, and Users) relationships. Update the necessary fields, then click "Save".
        <ul>
            <li>Please note that you can also click the Actions Menu to the right of the Save button to select the "Save and view" or "Save and create new" options. Save and view will display the record's details after the save is complete. The Save and create new option saves the current record and opens a new, blank record view in edit mode where the user can create another record.</li>
        </ul><br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/4a11f509-b9ff-c154-0cde-5503067eed43.png" alt="" width="450" height="304" /></li>

<h2 id="d9cb2f7b-b601-60f7-5f90-556f637df06d_Searching_Target_Lists">Searching Target Lists</h2>
<p>The Target Lists list view includes a module search to help you locate records easily and effectively in a module-specific manner. Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Target Lists list view below. Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Please note that Global Search is disabled for the Target Lists module by default and must be enabled via Admin &gt; Search. For more information on how to enable and disable modules for Global Search, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/05_System#Enabling_Modules_for_Global_Search">Systems</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<p>Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %services). This will pull up any record that has the word "services" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends. For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Search">Search</a> documentation.</p>
<h3 id="d9cb2f7b-b601-60f7-5f90-556f637df06d_Module_Search">Module Search</h3>
<p>Module search enables users to easily search by name within the Target Lists module and pull up matching records in the list view. The search also provides a Filter option which can be used in combination with the open Search box to narrow your search further using the available options as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Create</strong> : Create a new custom filter which you can use to filter your search
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Note</strong>: You can also click "Create" to the right of the Filter option.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>All Target Lists</strong> : Returns all records in the module to which you have access</li>
    <li><strong>My Favorites</strong> : Returns only records you have marked as favorites</li>
    <li><strong>My Target Lists</strong> : Returns only records assigned to you</li>
    <li><strong>Recently Created </strong>: Returns only records you created in the module within the last 7 days</li>
    <li><strong>Recently Viewed </strong>: Returns only records you have viewed in the module within the last 7 days</li>
</ul>

<p>When you choose a filter, Sugar will return target lists which match both the selected filter and any name provided in the "Search by name..." bar in the filtered list view results. For example, if you select "My Target Lists" in the Filter options and enter a target list name, Sugar will only return target lists with a matching name that are assigned to you. Once the search is complete, the relevant results will populate in the <a href="#d9cb2f7b-b601-60f7-5f90-556f637df06d_Target_Lists_List_View">list view</a> below the search bar. To see all target list records to which you have access, simply select the All Target Lists option in the filter and remove any text from the search bar. You can also click the Clear icon within the selected filter option (e.g. My Target Lists) in the Search bar to clear the filter and pull up all list view search results. When you run a search using a saved or created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5dc723a2-2e7c-f875-8d05-55030695adfa.png" alt="" height="196" width="303" /></p>

<p>Users can also create new filters via the Create option in the Filter list of the search bar. This allows users to add custom, complex filter options when searching in the Target Lists list view. You have the option to add multiple fields to your new filter by clicking the Plus button to the right of the filter selection dropdown lists and set select operators along with their value(s). A filter's criteria need to be true for a record in order for it to appear in the list view search result. Additionally, filters with no specified values may be saved as a custom filter to act as a filter template when a user often searches using the same fields but with varying values. Please note that only fields you have view access for will appear in the Filter list when creating a search filter.</p>
<p>When you run a search using a created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away.</p>
<p>The following steps cover creating a new Type filter as an example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click the Filter option on the Target Lists search bar then select "Create".
        <ul>
            <li>You can also click "Create" to the right of the Filter option.</li>

    <li>Select the field you wish to add to your filter as well as the condition and matching criteria.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Note</strong>: Only fields you have view access for will be available to add in the Filter list.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>To add additional fields to the new filter, click the Plus button to the right of the filter.
        <ul>
            <li>To remove fields from the new filter, click the Minus button to the right of the filter.</li>
            <li>To clear any filter values (e.g. Default), simply click the "x" to the right of the value or select "Reset" to the left of the Save button.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/2f452bdc-c143-6236-f93f-550306062099.png" alt="" width="563" height="176" /></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>The list view will automatically display results matching your filters as you create and modify the criteria.</p>
<h4 id="d9cb2f7b-b601-60f7-5f90-556f637df06d_Saving_a_Filter">Saving a Filter</h4>
<p>Saving a filter will preserve the chosen fields as well as the condition(s) of the matching value(s). Additionally, it will allow users to easily select previously created and saved filters from the Filter options.</p>
<p>The following steps cover saving a new search by Name filter as an example:</p>
<ol>

<h3 id="d9cb2f7b-b601-60f7-5f90-556f637df06d_Global_Search">Global Search</h3>
<p>Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Beginning with version 6.5.0, Full Text Search is used with Global Search to search throughout nearly all fields and modules for an enhanced search experience. The Global Search bar is located on the top right hand side of Sugar. You can click the magnifying glass icon or hit Return/Enter to perform your search once the text string is entered in the search box. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/454701b8-4177-e96e-c35a-5503066586a1.png" alt="" width="293" height="39" /></p>
<p>To use global search, you need to first enter the keyword into the search box and the pop-up results will begin appearing once you enter in at least one character. Clicking the magnifying glass icon or hitting your Return/Enter key will cause Sugar to return exact matches for your keyword rather than matches with words beginning with your keyword. For more information on using and configuring Global Search, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Global_Search">Global Search</a> sectionof the Search documentation.</p>
<p>Regular Sugar users can configure some aspects of global search such as what modules are displayed in the search results by clicking the down arrow within the search box then selecting the module(s) to include in the search. For more information on configuring your Global Search, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Global_Search">Search</a> documentation. Administrators can control additional elements of global search via Admin &gt; Search. For more information on administrator configuration of Global Search, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Field_Options">Field Options</a> section of the Studio documentation as well as the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/05_System#Search">Search</a> section of the System documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<h2 id="d9cb2f7b-b601-60f7-5f90-556f637df06d_Populating_Target_Lists">Populating Target Lists</h2>
<p>A target list consists of a group of individuals or organizations (e.g. targets, contacts, accounts, etc.) you wish to be included or excluded on a mass marketing campaign. These targets are typically identified based on a set of predetermined criteria such as being a prospect or existing customer, age group, industry, etc. There are various ways to populate a target list in Sugar including using the Add to Target List option from a module's list view, selecting records from the subpanel in the Target Lists record view, etc. You can use the <a href="#d9cb2f7b-b601-60f7-5f90-556f637df06d_Checkbox_Selection">Select All</a> feature in the module's list view when adding to a target list, which will allow you to easily select the first 1000 records in the result set. If you wish to add more than 1000 records or add a specific group of records to the target list, please use the <a href="#d9cb2f7b-b601-60f7-5f90-556f637df06d_Module_Search">filter option</a> in module search to perform the additions in smaller batches.</p>
<p>Please note that if you have multiple targets with the same email address, Sugar will send the campaign email to only one of the targets, chosen at random. The other email addresses which are considered duplicates will be suppressed even though they are not on the opt-out list.</p>

<h3 id="d9cb2f7b-b601-60f7-5f90-556f637df06d_Subpanels">Subpanels</h3>
<p>Beneath a target list record's fields are subpanels containing related records from various modules such as Targets, Contacts, Leads, etc. The related records in the subpanels are considered targets for a mass marketing campaign and they are typically identified based on a set of predetermined criteria such as being a prospect or existing customer, age group, industry, etc. Selecting the Data View button will display the subpanels rather than the record's activity stream.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/db7343f1-a5d7-8ce4-a421-5503060feafb.png" alt="" width="533" height="172" /></p>
<h4 id="d9cb2f7b-b601-60f7-5f90-556f637df06d_Filter_Options">Filter Options</h4>
<p>While in Data View, all of the target list record's related records will be displayed beneath the target list record's fields. Users have the ability to search for records which appear in the subpanels as well as filter the view to only display a specific module (e.g. Leads, Contacts, etc.). To locate a record by name, enter the keyword into the Search bar, and the subpanel(s) with the matching record(s) will appear below. To filter, simply click the Related option to the far left of the Search bar and select the module whose subpanel you wish to view. Filter and search may be combined to only display matching records within a selected module. To see all subpanels to which you have access, simply select "All" in the Related options and remove any text from the search bar. When you run a search using a saved or created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the page. Returning to the page will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/3d2eed29-4f81-d0c5-a99a-550306f821c2.png" alt="" width="487" height="141" /></p>
<p>When a Sidecar module (e.g. Contacts, Leads, Targets, etc.) is selected from the Related options, you have the option to filter the related subpanels further using one of the available options (e.g. My Favorites, Recently Created, etc.). Please note that you can also create custom filters for related Sidecar modules. Once the related module (e.g. Targets) is selected, either click the Filter option and select "Create" or click "Create" to the right of the Filter option. For more information on creating a related records filter, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Creating_a_Related_Records_Filter">Creating a Related Records Filter</a> section of the Search documentation.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/ec11ec0f-eeb9-22e5-b8e5-5503064f823a.png" alt="" height="215" width="501" /></p>

<h2 id="e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>There are several key components involved when executing an email or newsletter campaign in Sugar. Before sending out an email-based campaign, an administrator must make sure the following items are set up properly:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Outbound Emails</strong> : Configure Sugar to send outbound emails via Admin &gt; Email Settings. For more information on configuring outbound email, please refer to <a href="#e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Set_Up_Email">Set Up Email</a> below or to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/06_Email#Outgoing_Mail_Configuration">Email</a> documentation in the Administration Guide.</li>
    <li><strong>Campaign Batch Size</strong> : Specify the number of emails sent per batch via Admin &gt; Campaign Email Settings. Due to some email providers throttling the number of emails allowed to be sent at one time, we recommend setting this to 200 and adjusting as necessary. For more information on configuring the campaign batch size, please refer to <a href="#e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Set_Up_Email">Set Up Email</a> below or to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/06_Email#Campaign_Email_Settings">Email</a> documentation in the Administration Guide.</li>
    <li><strong>Bounce Handling Account</strong> : Create the bounce-handling inbox for bounced campaign emails via Admin &gt; Inbound Email. For more information on configuring the bounce handling account, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/06_Email#Creating_Bounce_Handling_Accounts">Email</a> documentation in the Administration Guide.</li>
    <li><strong>Campaigns Scheduler</strong> : Configure the scheduler job that automatically sends campaign emails via Admin &gt; Schedulers &gt; Run Nightly Mass Email Campaigns Scheduler. The frequency of this scheduler should be determined in conjunction with the campaign batch size to ensure you do not exceed sending limitations imposed by your email provider. For more information on configuring schedulers, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/05_System/41_Schedulers#Run_Nightly_Mass_Email_Campaigns">Schedulers</a> documentation in the Administration Guide.</li>
    <li><strong>Bounced Emails Scheduler</strong> : Configure the scheduler job to process the bounced campaign emails via Admin &gt; Schedulers &gt; Run Nightly Process Bounced Campaign Emails Scheduler. For more information on configuring schedulers, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/05_System/41_Schedulers#Run_Nightly_Process_Bounced_Campaign_Emails">Schedulers</a> documentation in the Administration Guide. <br /><strong>Note</strong>: The Run Nightly Mass Email Campaigns and Run Nightly Processed Bounced Campaign Emails schedulers are configured by default to run every night on the hour from 2:00 AM to 6:00 AM for the time zone of the admin user (User Id = 1). For quicker processing of campaign information we recommend changing both schedulers to run every 10 minutes throughout the day. Please note that if your email provider throttles the number of emails allowed to be sent in a given time period, you may need to reduce the frequency of sending.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Set_Up_Email">Set Up Email</h3>
<p>In addition to navigating directly to the email settings on the Administration page, you can also configure Sugar's email settings for campaigns via the Set Up Email option in the Campaigns module tab. This launches a wizard that walks through entering all of the relevant information for email set up. Please note that the Set Up Email option is only available to administrators and only needs to be configured once for your Sugar instance. <br />Use the following steps to configure email settings via the Campaigns module:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click the triangle in the Campaigns module tab to open the Actions menu and select "Set Up Email".<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/de9e7579-c782-8697-7080-550307e888de.png" alt="" width="315" height="252" /></li>
    <li>Enter the appropriate values specific to your email server in the fields on the Setup Email page. Please note that any values entered on this page will affect the system-wide email settings in Admin &gt; Email Settings. Click "Next". <br /><strong>Note</strong>: All required fields (e.g. From Name, From Address, SMTP Server, etc.) are marked with a red asterisk and must be completed. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8b702872-c49a-a1ee-13e9-5503071cebd0.png" alt="" width="600" height="230" /></li>
    <li>Enter the appropriate information to set up your bounce-handling email account on the New Mail Account page. Click "Next". <br /><strong>Note</strong>: A message will display if you already have an existing bounce-handling account, but you can mark the Create New Mail Account checkbox if you wish to create another one. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e1477379-e2e5-2d76-dd86-550307fcb034.png" alt="" width="720" height="290" /></li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
    <li>The Summary page will display a summary of the information you entered on the previous steps. Click "Save" to preserve your changes.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/3d6724ed-5e96-e9bb-d097-550307323df8.png" alt="" width="550" height="336" /></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Campaign_Diagnostic_Tool">Campaign Diagnostic Tool</h3>
<p>The campaign diagnostic tool enables you to check if all pending administrative tasks have been completed before you attempt to launch the campaign. It is recommended that the Campaign Diagnostic tool be run prior to sending out campaigns to ensure any issues get resolved before the campaign emails need to be sent.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to run the campaign diagnostic tool:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Click the Actions menu in the Campaigns module tab and select "View Diagnostics".<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/3cd5e952-5150-4fb4-41e7-550307d76d06.png" alt="" width="330" height="293" /></p>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
    <li>
        <p>Sugar will check your instance's email and scheduler configuration and display warnings if any additional configuration is necessary. Administrator users will also see links (e.g. Launch Email Setup) to appropriate sections of the Administration page to correct the issues. <br /><strong>Note</strong>: If you are not an administrator user, please reach out to your system administrator to have the issues looked into and resolved accordingly. For more information on the required elements for campaigns, please refer to the <a href="#e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Prerequisites">Prerequisites</a> section above.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/3ed1fd3d-7f19-f023-3370-55030797612d.png" alt="" width="650" height="489" /></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Once all necessary configurations have been completed, click the Re-Check button to re-run the campaign diagnostic tool.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Campaign_Types">Campaign Types</h2>
<p>Sugar supports many different types of campaigns. The main types and their differences are as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Newsletter</strong> : A series of mass emails sent to a consistent or growing target list periodically or on a regular basis. Each newsletter is intended to be managed on a subscription basis and is normally targeted towards individuals with whom you have an existing relationship. The Frequency field is only available for campaigns with the type set to "Newsletter". Recipients opting out of newsletter-type campaigns are added to that campaign's unsubscription list but will still be able to receive other campaigns' emails.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Email Campaign</strong> : A one-time or series of mass emails sent to a target list. Email campaigns are typically targeted towards a wide audience with the intention of lead generation. Recipients opting out of email-type campaigns have their email address marked as "opt-out" and are prevented from receiving any future campaign emails.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Non-email based Campaign</strong> : A non-email mass marketing effort delivered via mail, web, radio, television, print, or telesales. These campaigns are not executed through Sugar, but you can create a campaign record and manually update send dates and results for record keeping and to assess return on investment.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Non-email based campaigns will not display Tracker URLs and Email Marketing subpanels in the detail view.</p>
<h2 id="e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Creating_Campaigns">Creating Campaigns</h2>
<p>There are two primary methods for creating a campaign in Sugar: the Create Campaign (Classic) option and the Create Campaign (Wizard) option. When using the classic option, you will create the campaign record then add the target list and create tracker URLs as well as an email marketing record via the related subpanels below the campaign's detail. The classic option is recommended for simplicity and empowering users to make modifications to the campaign later. The campaign wizard option will walk you through getting the campaign created step-by-step. Each step of the campaign set-up process will guide users on the items (Tracker URLs, Target List, Marketing, etc.) that need to be completed.</p>
<h3 id="e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Creating_Via_Classic_Option">Creating Via Classic Option</h3>
<p>Creating a campaign using the classic method opens the Campaigns edit view where you may enter the basic campaign information. Use the following steps to create a campaign via the classic option:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Click the Actions menu in the Campaigns module tab and select "Create Campaign (Classic)". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8153b8fb-0917-a007-0583-550307682257.png" alt="" width="350" height="147" /></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Enter appropriate values for the <a href="#e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Campaign_Fields">fields</a> in the edit view layout which will help identify the campaign. All required fields are marked with a red asterisk and must be completed prior to saving.<br /><strong>Note</strong>: The status, start date, and end date entered on this screen are for your records only and will not control when the actual email campaign will be executed.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Once the necessary information is entered, click "Save".<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/3c07d3ee-db62-1628-9393-550307074590.png" alt="" width="310" height="190" /></p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Once the campaign record is created, scroll to the related subpanels below the campaign's detail to add the <a href="#e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Creating_Target_Lists">target list</a> and create the <a href="#e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Creating_Tracker_URLs">tracker URLs</a> as well as an <a href="#e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Creating_Email_Marketing_Records">email marketing</a> record.</p>
<h3 id="e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Creating_Via_Duplication">Creating Via Duplication</h3>
<p>You can also create a new campaign by duplicating an existing campaign record. The Copy option is useful if the campaign you are creating has similar information to an existing campaign. When duplicating a campaign, the campaign data, and the related target lists will copy over, but the original campaign's tracker URLs and Email Marketing records will not be related to the new campaign. <br />Use the following steps to create a campaign by duplicating an existing campaign record:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to a campaign record's detail view.</li>
    <li>Click the Actions menu and select "Copy".<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/bdd8177e-475a-0343-ea44-5503071345ff.png" alt="" width="310" height="151" /></li>
    <li>The displayed edit view is pre-populated with the original campaign's values. Update the necessary fields, then click "Save".<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/be9d0746-a082-4b1a-092e-5503079525b7.png" alt="" width="330" height="169" /></li>
</ol>
<p>Once the campaign record has been created, scroll to the related subpanels below the campaign's detail to add the <a href="#e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Creating_Target_Lists">target list</a> and create the <a href="#e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Creating_Tracker_URLs">tracker URLs</a> as well as an <a href="#e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Creating_Email_Marketing_Records">email marketing</a> record.</p>
<h3 id="e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Creating_Target_Lists">Creating Target Lists</h3>
<p>A target list consists of a collection of individuals or organizations you want to include or exclude in a mass marketing campaign. Target lists can contain any number and combination of contacts, leads, targets, users, and accounts. You have the option to associate existing target lists with your new campaign or to create new target lists during the campaign creation process.</p>
<p>The target list type determines some specific functionality within the campaign. The available target list types are "Default", "Seed", "Suppression List", and "Test". Default and Seed-type target lists will receive emails when campaigns are sent. Test-type target lists will receive emails when campaigns are tested.</p>
<p>Sugar will also create some target lists for you by default. For example, when selecting a campaign type of "Newsletter", Sugar automatically generates three target lists for the campaign: default-type "Subscription List", suppression by ID-type "Unsubscription List", and test-type "Test List". Please note that these three target list types are required for the Newsletter campaign. You may add additional target list types to the campaign as necessary. If you wish to remove the system generated target list types (e.g. suppression by ID-type "Unsubscription List"), please keep in mind that you must replace it with the same target list type (e.g. Suppression List - By Id).</p>
<p>For more information about target lists, please refer to the <a href="#d9cb2f7b-b601-60f7-5f90-556f637df06d_Creating_Target_Lists">Target Lists</a> documentation.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to add an existing target list to your campaign via the Target List subpanel on the Campaigns detail view:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to the Target List subpanel.</li>
    <li>Choose "Select" from the Actions menu.<br /><strong>Note</strong>: Click the Create button if you wish to create a new target list for the campaign.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/4872393c-e637-0951-7c2c-550307033326.png" alt="" width="275" height="120" /></li>
    <li>Locate and select the name of the desired target list in the pop-up window. To add several target lists at once, mark the specific record's corresponding checkbox then click "Select". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/43f2555e-0a67-ce19-4c89-550307996cc3.png" alt="" width="450" height="384" /></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Creating_Tracker_URLs">Creating Tracker URLs</h3>
<p>Tracker URLs are links to websites that are hosted either internally or externally. These links can be embedded into your email template to help you understand how your recipients are using the campaign email. When the link is clicked, it either opens a website, <a href="#bb0b26-31d8-710f-915a-551b22592c2a_Web-To-Lead_Forms">web-to-lead form</a>, or other URL in your recipient's browser. If you choose to create your links as tracker links, then Sugar will log your recipient's clicks by assigning each tracker link a unique key and routing the link through Sugar before loading the final URL in their browser. The click-through results can be reported on and are visible in the Campaign Status section of the Campaigns module. For more information on the Campaign Status page, please refer to the <a href="#e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Campaign_Status">Campaign Status</a> section of this documentation. A specific type of tracker URL is the opt-out link which allows the recipient to opt out of receiving your campaign emails instead of directing them to another web location.</p>
<h4 id="e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Creating_Redirect_URLs">Creating Redirect URLs</h4>
<p>Redirect tracker URLs can appear as text or images in your campaign email and when clicked, will navigate your recipient's browser to the URL of your choice: a page within your organization's website, a targeted advertisement, or even a web-to-lead form where they can provide details that will be saved as a Sugar lead record. For more information on web-to-lead forms, please refer to the <a href="#bb0b26-31d8-710f-915a-551b22592c2a_Web-To-Lead_Forms">Web To Lead Forms</a> documentation. The power of redirect URLs is that on each click they pass through your Sugar instance before arriving at their final destination. This allows the clicks to be tracked by your campaign to provide visibility into how your recipients are responding to the campaign.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to create a redirect URL via your campaign's detail view:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to the Tracker URLs subpanel.</li>
    <li>Click the Create button to create a new tracker URL.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/7066fa04-312e-adbe-189a-5503075eb9fb.png" alt="" width="360" height="112" /></li>
    <li>Enter appropriate values in the fields on the page. All required fields are marked with a red asterisk and must be completed. <br /><strong>Tracker Name</strong> : Enter an internal name for the tracker URL. <br /><strong>Opt-out Link</strong> : Leave this box unchecked. <br /><strong>Tracker URL</strong> : Enter the destination URL where recipients will be directed to after clicking the link in the email.</li>
    <li>Click "Save" to create the tracker URL record. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/86b56c17-20c2-bb12-b94a-550307837f56.png" alt="" width="450" height="154" /></li>
</ol>
<p>You can now insert this tracker URL into the email template of your choice. For more information on adding redirect URL links to your template, please refer to the <a href="#e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Creating_Email_Templates">Creating Email Templates</a> section of this documentation.</p>
<h4 id="e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Creating_Opt-out_Links">Creating Opt-out Links</h4>
<p>You can create an opt-out tracker URL to embed an Unsubscribe link in the campaign email which will allow the targets to opt out of your campaign mailing list. If an opt-out link is not included in the email template, Sugar will add a default opt-out link to the bottom of your campaign email. When targets click on the Opt-out link, Sugar logs the action for your records and the target receives a message stating they have elected to opt out of receiving future emails. <br /><b>Note</b>:<b></b>The message returned to targets can be modified by changing the LBL_ELECTED_TO_OPTOUT label via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on how to modify labels, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Editing_Labels">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<p>For a newsletter-type campaign, they will also be added to the suppression-type list which prevents them from receiving emails for that particular campaign in the future. In the case of an email-type campaign, their email address is marked as "Opted Out" on the target's record (e.g. Contact) to prevent them from receiving emails for any campaign. You must manually add your opt-out link by inserting the tracker URL into the email template via the Email Marketing record. <br /><strong>Note</strong>: Opt-out links for newsletters behave differently than other campaign types. When a target clicks an opt-out for a newsletter type campaign they are removed only from the specific campaign that sent the email. They are still able to receive email from other campaigns. <br />Use the following steps to create an opt-out link via your campaign's detail view:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to the Tracker URLs subpanel.</li>
    <li>Click the Create button to create a new tracker URL.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/7066fa04-312e-adbe-189a-5503075eb9fb.png" alt="" width="390" height="122" /></li>
    <li>Enter appropriate values in the fields on the page. All required fields are marked with a red asterisk and must be completed. <br /><strong>Tracker Name </strong>: Enter an internal name for the tracker URL. <br /><strong>Opt-out Link </strong>: Mark the checkbox so that this link will be used to allow recipients to opt out. <br /><strong>Tracker URL</strong> : This is defaulted and disabled for opt-out links.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/c22b237a-9dc6-efd2-d8e8-550307697430.png" alt="" width="450" height="153" /></li>
    <li>Click "Save" to create the opt-out tracker URL record.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can now insert this tracker URL into the email template of your choice. For more information on adding an opt-out link to your template, please refer to the <a href="#e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Creating_Email_Templates">Creating Email Templates</a> section of this documentation.</p>
<h3 id="e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Creating_Email_Marketing_Records">Creating Email Marketing Records</h3>
<p>When you create an email campaign, you must also create an Email Marketing record that specifies the body of the message in the form of an email template, which bounce handling account will catch automated replies from invalid email addresses, and which target lists will receive this particular mass email of your campaign. <br />When you are sending more than once from a single campaign, both newsletter-type and email-type campaigns will need a new Email Marketing for each subsequent send. For example, a monthly newsletter campaign will have 12 Email Marketing records created in a year, each one with a different email template with the same target lists. Or, if you wish to send an introductory email to all of your newest prospects every 3 months, this email-type campaign will have 4 Email Marketing records created in a year, each one using the same email template but different target lists. Sugar will not allow the same Email Marketing record to be sent to a recipient more than once.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to create an Email Marketing record via your campaign's detail view:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click the Create button to create a new email marketing record. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/25e80c34-56a1-e503-350e-550307189e83.png" alt="" width="400" height="127" /></li>
    <li>Complete the fields as follows. All required fields are marked with a red asterisk and must be completed. </li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Name</strong> : Enter an internal name for the email marketing record.</li>
    <li><strong>Status</strong> : Select "Active" from the dropdown. Only active Email Marketing records may be sent.</li>
    <li><strong>Start Date &amp; Time</strong> : Enter a date and time when the emails need to begin sending. This start date and time must have passed before the campaign may be queued for delivery.</li>
    <li><strong>Email Template</strong> : Select or create an email template. For more information on creating an email template, please refer to the <a href="#e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Creating_Email_Templates">Creating Email Templates</a> section of this documentation.</li>
    <li><strong>Send This Message To</strong> : Check this box to send this email to all target lists that are associated with this campaign or select individual target lists via the multiselect box below. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/ec3eb439-d7eb-09ce-ad55-5503071dbb30.png" alt="" width="377" height="188" /></li>
    <li><strong>Use Mailbox</strong> : Select the bounce handling account that will catch automated replies from invalid email addresses.</li>
    <li><strong>From Name</strong> : This will automatically populate based on the selected bounce handling account. You can enter a different name that will appear as the email's From name.</li>
    <li><strong>From Email Address</strong> : This will automatically populate based on the selected bounce handling account. You can override the field to enter a different email address that the campaign will be sent from. Please note that your system outbound email account may need to grant specific 'Send As' permissions if you wish to use a From email address that differs from the address set up in Admin &gt; Email Settings. If these permissions are not granted, emails may fail to send or the authenticated email account will be imposed in place of the address depending on your mail server settings. Also, if the From address entered is not configured as a bounce handling email address in Sugar, you will not see the results of the bounced emails in your campaign's <a href="#e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Viewing_Campaign_Status">Status page</a> .</li>
    <li><strong>"Reply-to" Name</strong> : This field will automatically populate if a Reply-to name is provided on the bounce handling account. You can override the Reply-to name to a different one so that any replies on the email campaign can be addressed to this name on the email.</li>
    <li><strong>"Reply-to" Address</strong> : This field will automatically populate if a Reply-to address is provided on the bounce handling account. Please note that if any recipients reply back to the email campaign, it will be sent to this email address on the bounce handling account by default. You can override the Reply-to address for the campaign to a different one so that any replies can be sent to a specific email address where it can be better monitored.</li>

<h3 id="e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Creating_Email_Templates">Creating Email Templates</h3>
<p>Email templates contain the design and content of the emails your campaign will send. Placeholder variables can be added to the template for field values like the target name so you can personalize the email to your recipients. Creating an email template through the Campaigns module rather than via the Emails module sets the template's type to "Campaign" and allows you to add redirect and opt-out tracker URLs.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to create an email template from the Email Marketing record:</p>
<ol>
    <li>While creating or editing your campaign's Email Marketing record, click "Create" to the right of the Email Template dropdown.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8d790909-cd96-f050-75b6-550307fe62e7.png" alt="" width="700" height="134" /></li>
    <li>Enter the appropriate values for the fields in the pop-up window. The required field is marked with a red asterisk and must be completed.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Name</strong> : Enter an internal name for the email template.</li>
    <li><strong>Teams</strong> : Select the Sugar team(s) assigned to the email template.</li>
    <li><strong>Type</strong> : This will automatically populate as "Campaign".</li>
    <li><strong>Description</strong> : Enter a description or other information about the template.</li>
    <li><strong>Insert Variable</strong> : Insert variables or placeholders into the template. For more information regarding inserting variables, please refer to the <a href="#e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Inserting_Variables">Inserting Variables</a> section.</li>
    <li><strong>Insert Tracker URL</strong> : Insert a tracker URL or opt-out link into the template. For more information regarding inserting tracker URLs, please refer to the <a href="#e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Inserting_Tracker_URLs">Inserting Tracker URLs</a> section.</li>
    <li><strong>Subject</strong> : Enter the subject of the emails that will be sent.</li>
    <li><strong>Body</strong> : Enter the body of the emails that will be sent.</li>
    <li>Using the TinyMCE functions, add simple formatting to your email's content. For more advanced customization you can click the HTML button in the top left to access and edit the generated HTML code. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/3a2c92c4-3210-e398-5174-550307551d19.png" alt="" width="630" height="79" /><br /><strong>Note</strong>: If images or advanced CSS are required in your email template, it is highly recommended to host the images or CSS file on a publicly available hosting service and link to it in the email template.</li>
    <li>Click "Save" to preserve your changes to the email template.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/4920db3c-637c-b837-3f05-55030701da95.png" alt="" width="320" height="200" /></li>

<h2 id="e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Testing_Campaigns">Testing Campaigns</h2>
<p>Before you launch an email or newsletter campaign, it is recommended that you perform tests to check how different email clients display the campaign message. A test-type target list must be selected under the Target Lists subpanel as well as in the Email Marketing record in order to test the campaign.</p>
<p>Note that in test mode, the system disables your suppression lists allowing the campaign message to be sent to targets on your suppression-type target lists. The system also disables checks for duplicate email addresses thereby allowing users to send a message multiple times to the same recipients. <br />Use the following steps to test an email-based campaign:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to a campaign record's detail view.</li>
    <li>Select "Send Test" from the Actions menu.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d0bfa91f-06c4-4fd6-aab3-550307987863.png" alt="" width="250" height="158" /></li>
    <li>Select the Email Marketing record and test target list combination that you would like to test and click "Send".<br /><strong>Note</strong>: If an Email Marketing record does not have a test-type target list associated to it, then the Targeted Lists section will remain empty and no test emails will be sent.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/c9cc0acb-022c-42a4-f01a-55030773ed89.png" alt="" width="550" height="136" /></li>
</ol>
<p>You can send the campaign to the test target list multiple times by clicking the Delete Test Entries button on the <a href="#e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Viewing_Campaign_Status">View Status</a> page. You will need to do this after each test in order to delete the log entries on the campaign status and allow Sugar to send to the test list recipients again. Please note that sending to these recipients again will be prevented until the previous test's entries have been deleted. Also, please be sure that the test entries are all deleted once the campaign is ready to be sent so that the statistics from the test will not be included in the actual campaign's results.</p>
<h2 id="e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Sending_Campaigns">Sending Campaigns</h2>
<p>Once the Sugar email settings are configured and your campaign has been tested successfully, you are now ready to send the campaign. Upon sending a campaign, the emails are queued to be sent out in intervals. The administrator can configure how many emails are sent and when to send them. For more information on the relevant configurations, please refer to the <a href="#e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Prerequisites">Prerequisites</a> section. <br />Use the following steps to send an email-based campaign:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to a campaign record's detail view.</li>
    <li>Select "Send Emails" from the Actions menu.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/1e2183a5-c082-f5d9-4af4-550307bf0db4.png" alt="" width="260" height="164" /></li>
    <li>Select the Email Marketing record and default target list that you would like to receive the email campaign then click "Send". <br /><strong>Note</strong>: If the email marketing record does not have a default-type target list associated to it, then the Targeted Lists section will remain empty and no emails will be sent. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/1c3482c0-b6ce-66e1-ca29-5503075b2164.png" alt="" width="550" height="181" /></li>
</ol>
<p>The specified start date and time on the email marketing record must have passed before the campaign will be queued for delivery. Once the emails enter the queue in Admin &gt; Email Queue, the relevant scheduler will send the emails in set batches on an interval configured by an administrator. For more information on the email queue, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/06_Email#Email_Queue">Email</a> documentation in the Administration guide. For more information on the schedulers used by the Campaigns module, please refer to the <a href="#e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Prerequisites">Prerequisites</a> section.</p>
<h2 id="e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Viewing_Campaign_Status">Viewing Campaign Status</h2>
<p>After you launch a campaign, you can view its results on the Campaign Status page to gauge its impact and progress. The Campaign Status page includes several subpanels, which display information such as the recipients who viewed the message, the recipients who clicked a tracker URL in the email, how many leads and contacts were created from the campaign, etc. This enables you to evaluate the effectiveness of the campaign. <br />Use the following steps to view the Campaign Status page:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to a campaign record's detail view.</li>
    <li>Click the View Status button on the upper right of the page.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/9436a86f-3822-4350-3063-55028466b7ef.png" alt="" width="530" height="74" /></li>

<h3 id="e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Message_Queue_Subpanel">Message Queue Subpanel</h3>
<p>The Message Queue subpanel shows the campaign emails waiting to be sent in the email queue. The emails will remain in the queue until the start time of the Email Marketing record has passed and the scheduler picks up and sends them in batches as specified in Admin &gt; Campaign Email Settings. For more information on batch size, please refer to the <a href="#e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Prerequisites">Prerequisites</a> section.

<h3 id="e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Campaign_Response_Subpanels">Campaign Response Subpanels</h3>
<p>The success of a campaign can be determined by analyzing the response statistics. Knowing how many of your targets saw your email, clicked its links, and became leads or contacts, for example, can provide insight for your campaign strategy. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/46340397-9471-5962-d852-550307e9b242.png" alt="" width="670" height="116" /></p>
<p>The following subpanels measure different aspects of your recipient's responses to the campaign or a specific send of the campaign based on your selection in the Filter Chart By dropdown at the top of the page:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Message Sent/Attempted</strong> : The list of campaign emails that were sent out to targets.</li>
    <li><strong>Viewed Message</strong> : The list of targets who viewed the emails that were delivered. Sugar includes a very small, invisible image in each email. Each time the recipient downloads this image, Sugar records that they viewed the email.</li>
    <li><strong>Click-thru Link</strong> : The list of targets who clicked on a redirect tracker URL in the email. This does not include opt-outs. For more information on redirect tracker URLs, please refer to the <a href="#e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Creating_Tracker_URLs">Creating Tracker URLs</a> section.</li>
    <li><strong>Leads Created</strong> : The list of leads who have been generated from a web-to-lead form assigned to this campaign record.</li>
    <li><strong>Contacts Created</strong> : The list of contacts who have been converted from a lead generated from a web-to-lead form assigned to this campaign record.</li>
    <li><strong>Bounced Messages, Invalid Email </strong>: The list of campaign emails that bounced back due to invalid email addresses.</li>
    <li><strong>Bounced Messages, Other</strong> : The list of campaign emails that failed to send six times and were removed from the queue.</li>
    <li><strong>Opted Out</strong> : The list of targets who chose to opt out of receiving campaign emails by clicking the opt-out link. <br /><strong>Note</strong>: Opt-out links for newsletter-type and email-type campaigns behave differently. When a target clicks an opt-out for a newsletter-type campaign, they are prevented from receiving future emails from that specific campaign by being added to the campaign's suppression-type list. When clicking an opt-out for an email-type campaign, they are prevented from receiving future emails from any campaign by having their email address marked as "Opted Out" on their Sugar record.</li>
    <li><strong>Suppressed by Email Address or domain</strong> : The list of email addresses which were not sent the campaign email because they had previously opted out, were a member of a suppression list, or were invalid addresses.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you do not see the campaign response subpanels, the administrator may have disabled the Campaign Log subpanels for your entire Sugar instance. Reach out to your Sugar administrator to have the Campaign Log subpanels displayed. For more information on displaying and hiding subpanels throughout Sugar, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools#Display_Modules_and_Subpanels">Developer Tools</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

<p>The Campaigns list view includes a Basic and Advanced Search to help you find your records easily and effectively in a module-specific manner. Once the search is performed, the relevant search results will be displayed in the Campaigns list view below. Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Please note that Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %offer). This will pull up any record that has the word "offer" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p>
<p>For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the Search documentation.</p>
<h3 id="e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Basic_Search">Basic Search</h3>

For example, if you select "My Items" and enter a campaign's name, Sugar will only return campaign records with a matching name that are assigned to you. Once the search is complete, the relevant results will populate in the <a href="#e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Campaigns_List_View">list view</a> below the search panel.

<h3 id="e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Advanced_Search">Advanced Search</h3>
<p>Advanced search offers a more in-depth search experience than Basic Search including additional fields, layout options, and saved search capability. From the Advanced search panel, you can click "Basic Search" for simplified searching.</p>
<p>The buttons, checkboxes, and dropdowns available in Advanced Search have the following functions:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Search</strong> : Click the Search button or press your Return/Enter key to perform the search.</li>
    <li><strong>Clear</strong> : Click the Clear button to clear all criteria from the searchable fields.</li>
    <li><strong>My Favorites</strong> : Select this box to return only records you have marked as favorites.</li>
    <li><strong>Layout Options</strong> : Use the expandable Layout Options section to configure your list view. For more information, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Layout_Options">Layout Options</a> section of the Search documentation.</li>
    <li><strong>Saved Searches</strong> : Save, recall, update, and delete searches which you use often. For more information, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Saved_Search">Saved Search</a> section of the Search documentation.</li>

For example, if you select "My Favorites" and enter in a campaign's name to search, Sugar will only return campaign records with a matching name that you have marked as favorites. When searching by a multiselect or dropdown field (e.g. "Assigned to"), however, Sugar will return records matching any of these selections. Once the search completes, the relevant results will populate in the <a href="#e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Campaigns_List_View">list view</a> below the search panel. To see all campaign records to which you have access, simply click "Clear" and then "Search" to perform a blank search with no filters.</p>
<p>Please note that you will only be able to see campaign records as allowed by your team membership, user access type, and assigned roles. For more information on teams and roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/031_Team_Management">Team Management</a> and <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide.

<h3 id="e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Global_Search">Global Search</h3>
<p>Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Beginning with version 6.5.0, Full Text Search may be used with Global Search to search throughout nearly all fields and modules for an enhanced search experience. The Global Search bar is located on the top right hand side of Sugar. You can click the magnifying glass icon or hit Return/Enter to perform your search once the text string is entered in the search box. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/2427cd3d-e503-cba3-c34c-550307503d13.png" alt="" width="372" height="48" /><br />To use global search, you need to first enter the keyword into the search box and the pop-up results will begin appearing once you enter in at least one character. Clicking the magnifying glass icon or hitting your Return/Enter key will cause Sugar to return exact matches for your keyword rather than matches with words beginning with your keyword.</p>
<p>For more information on using and configuring Global Search, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Global_Search">Global Search</a> section of the Search documentation. <br />Regular Sugar users can configure some aspects of global search such as what modules are displayed in the search results by clicking the down arrow within the Search box then selecting the module(s) to include in the search. For more information on configuring your Global Search, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Advanced_Options">Search</a> documentation.</p>
<p>Administrators can control additional elements of global search via Admin &gt; Search and Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on administrator configuration of Global Search, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Field_Options">Field Options </a>section of the Studio documentation as well as the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/05_System#Search">Search</a> section of the System documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

<h3 id="e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Pagination">Pagination</h3>
<p>List view displays the current search results broken into pages that you can scroll through rather than displaying potentially thousands of rows at once. To the right just below the search panel you can see which records of the total results set are currently being displayed. The two single-arrow Next and Previous buttons can be used to scroll through the records page-by-page. The two double-arrow First Page and Last Page buttons allow you to skip to the beginning or the end of your current results.</p>
<p>By default, Sugar displays 20 records per list view page, but administrators can change the number of records displayed via Admin &gt; System Settings.

<h2 id="e04e3-c084-473a-2763-551b22b0b8ab_Deleting_Campaigns">Deleting Campaigns</h2>
<p>If a campaign record is invalid or should no longer appear in your organization's Sugar instance, it may be deleted from either the Campaigns detail view or list view. Deleting via the detail view allows you to delete a single record while the list view allows for mass deleting multiple records at once. Deleting campaign records will not delete the related records and will only remove the relationship, so you may wish to also delete any related records to avoid orphaned records. <br />Please note that your ability to delete campaigns may be restricted by a role.</p>
<p>For more information on roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide.

<p>Sugar's Export option allows users to download all fields for the selected campaigns to their computers as a .CSV (comma-separated values) file. This may be useful when needing to use campaign data with other software such as Microsoft Excel. Due to PHP memory limitations on the server, there may be occasions when the application times out while exporting a large number of campaign records. If you encounter an error when performing this action, we recommend selecting the records in smaller batches.</p>
<p>Campaigns may be exported from the Campaigns list view by selecting "Export" from the Actions menu. Users with access to the Reports module also have the option of creating or accessing reports containing specifically chosen fields for campaigns and their related record(s). Please note that only Rows and Columns-type reports have the ability to be exported.

        <li>All required fields marked with an asterisk must be added to a column on the lead form prior to continuing.</li>
        <li>Once the fields you desire have been moved to the appropriate columns, click the Next button to continue. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/67f14c21-8c8a-1fd6-2258-550308a5718b.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/67f14c21-8c8a-1fd6-2258-550308a5718b.png" height="400" width="635" /></li>
        <li>Enter appropriate values for the fields in the next page of the wizard: <br /><strong>Form Header</strong> : This will be the title at the top of your form. A generic title has been populated; modify or remove this to suit your needs. <br /><strong>Form Description</strong> : This will be a brief description of the form and will show below the form header, but before the form begins. A generic description has been populated; modify or remove this to suit your needs. <br /><strong>Submit Button Label</strong> : Enter in the label for the button that will be used to complete the form. Submit is the default; you may change this to say "Sign Up", "Save", "Complete", or any other label to suit your needs. <br /><strong>Post URL</strong> : This is the location the form will send the data entered and is defaulted to your instance of Sugar. Select "Edit Post URL" to edit this field. <br /><strong>Note</strong> : If you change this location to be anything other than your Sugar instance then a lead will not be generated when the form is completed. <br /><span><strong>Redirect URL</strong> : This is the location your visitors will be directed to after completing the form. You may enter the location of your corporate website, a custom "Thanks for signing up" page, or any URL to suit your needs.<br /><strong>Note</strong> : Leaving this field empty will display a message that says: "Thank You For Your Submission".<br /><strong>Related Campaign</strong> : Use the Select button to e<span>nter an existing campaign that is related to this lead form. Leads generated from this form will automatically be associated to this campaign.</span><br /><strong>Assigned to</strong> : Use the Select button to e<span>nter the user to be assigned to the new lead record when the form is submitted. By default, this field is populated with the current user who is generating the form.</span><br /><strong>Team</strong> : <span><span>Enter the name of the team that is allowed access to the leads generated from this form. To change the primary team, either enter the team name here or select the team. By default the primary team selected will be Global. More than one team can be assigned simultaneously. </span>For more information on teams, please refer to the <span><span><a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/031_Team_Management">Team Management</a></span></span>documentation.</span>
            </span><br /><span><strong>Form Footer </strong>: The form footer displays the text entered here below the form inputs, but before the submit button.</span></li>

<h2 id="c80000-65f1-5acc-dfc3-551b22f01ba2_Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Sugar's Cases module is used to track and manage product or service related problems reported to your organization by customers. Cases are typically related to an account record, and multiple cases may be associated to a single account. There are various ways you can create cases in Sugar such as via the Cases module, importing cases, or converted from email. Once the case is created, you can view and edit information pertaining to the case via the Case's record view. Each case record may then relate to other Sugar records such as calls, contacts, bugs, and many others. This documentation will cover how to use the Cases module as well as the various actions and options available from within the module.</p>
<h2 id="c80000-65f1-5acc-dfc3-551b22f01ba2_Case_Fields">Case Fields</h2>
<p>The Cases module contains a number of stock fields which come out-of-the-box with Sugar. The below definitions are suggested meanings for the fields, but the fields can be leveraged differently to best meet your organization's needs. Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to alter, add, or remove fields via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on configuring fields, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Fields">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

<h2 id="c80000-65f1-5acc-dfc3-551b22f01ba2_Creating_Cases">Creating Cases</h2>
<p>There are various methods for creating cases in Sugar including via the Cases module, quick create, duplication, and importing cases. Customers can also create cases via emailing a specific email account or through the Case Portal. The full record view layout opens when creating the case directly from the Cases menu and includes all of the relevant fields for your organization's cases. The quick create form is a shortened version of the Cases record view and typically contains fewer fields. When using quick create to make a case while viewing an existing record of another module, Sugar automatically creates a relationship between both records. For example, if you are viewing an account record (e.g. ABC Company) and create a new case via the quick create form, the Account Name field in the case record will automatically populate with "ABC Company", thus creating the relationship. Both the record view and quick create layouts can be configured by administrators via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on configuring layouts, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Layouts">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<h3 id="c80000-65f1-5acc-dfc3-551b22f01ba2_Creating_Via_Cases_Module">Creating Via Cases Module</h3>
<p>One of the most common methods of case creation is via the Create Case option in the Cases module tab. This opens up the record view layout which allows you to enter in all the relevant information for the case. <br />Use the following steps to create a case via the Cases module:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click the triangle in the Cases module tab to open the actions menu and select "Create Case". You can also click the Create button on the upper right of the Cases list view. <br />From Cases module tab: <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8a23cde8-1919-ef01-63b9-5503068ea171.png" alt="" width="400" height="72" /><br />From Cases list view: <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/2205c72e-bda8-80ab-cbb5-550306d8a3dd.png" alt="" width="400" height="117" /></li>
    <li>Enter appropriate values for the <a href="#c80000-65f1-5acc-dfc3-551b22f01ba2_Case_Fields">fields</a> in the record view layout. All required fields are marked with a red asterisk and must be completed prior to saving. <br /><strong>Note:</strong> Case Number is marked with a red asterisk as it is a required field, but no value is required to be added for the save to occur.</li>
    <li>Once the necessary information is entered, click "Save".
        <ul>
            <li>Alternatively, you can use the Actions Menu to the right of the Save button to select "Save and view" or "Save and create new". "Save and view" will display the record's details after the save is complete. "Save and create new" saves the current record and opens a new, blank record view in edit mode where you can create another record.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="c80000-65f1-5acc-dfc3-551b22f01ba2_Searching_Cases">Searching Cases</h2>
<p>The Cases list view includes a Module Search to help you locate records easily and effectively in a module-specific manner. Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Cases list view below. Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Please note that Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %system). This will pull up any record that has the word "system" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p>
<p>For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Search">Search</a> documentation.</p>
<h3 id="c80000-65f1-5acc-dfc3-551b22f01ba2_Module_Search">Module Search</h3>
<p>Module search enables users to easily search by case number within the Cases module and pull up matching records in the list view. The search also provides a Filter option which can be used in combination with the open Search box to narrow your search further using the available options as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Create</strong> : Create a new custom filter which you can use to filter your search
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Note</strong>: You can also click "Create" to the right of the Filter option.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>All Cases</strong> : Returns all records in the module to which you have access</li>
    <li><strong>My Cases </strong>: Returns only records assigned to you</li>
    <li><strong>My Favorites</strong> : Returns only records you have marked as favorites</li>
    <li><strong>Recently Created </strong>: Returns only records you created in the module within the last 7 days</li>
    <li><strong>Recently Viewed </strong>: Returns only records you have viewed in the module within the last 7 days</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/2484d902-f494-ecbe-b223-550307057b07.png" alt="" height="280" width="492" /></p>
<p>When you choose a filter, Sugar will return cases which match both the selected filter and any name provided in the "Search by subject..." bar in the filtered list view results. For example, if you select "My Cases" in the Filter options and enter a case name, Sugar will only return case records with a matching name that are assigned to you. Once the search is complete, the relevant results will populate in the <a href="#c80000-65f1-5acc-dfc3-551b22f01ba2_Cases_List_View">list view</a> below the search bar. To see all case records to which you have access, simply select the All Cases option in the filter and remove any text from the search bar. You can also click the Clear icon within the selected filter option (e.g. My Cases) in the Search bar to clear the filter and pull up all list view search results. When you run a search using a saved or created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/77e10930-ccad-3a79-aa30-5503076d3f46.png" alt="" height="153" width="290" /></p>
<p>Please note that you will only be able to see case records as allowed by your team membership, user access type, and assigned roles. For more information on teams and roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/031_Team_Management">Teams</a> and <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Roles</a> documentation in the Administration guide.

<h4 id="c80000-65f1-5acc-dfc3-551b22f01ba2_Creating_a_Filter">Creating a Filter</h4>
<p>Users can also create new filters via the Create option in the Filter list of the search bar. This allows users to add custom, complex filter options when searching in the Cases list view. You have the option to add multiple fields to your new filter by clicking the Plus button to the right of the filter selection dropdown lists and set select operators along with their value(s). A filter's criteria need to be true for a record in order for it to appear in the list view search result. Additionally, filters with no specified values may be saved as a custom filter to act as a filter template when a user often searches using the same fields but with varying values. Please note that only fields you have view access for will appear in the Filter list when creating a search filter.</p>
<p>When you run a search using a created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away.</p>
<p>The following steps cover creating a new Assigned to filter as an example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click the Filter option on the Cases search bar then select "Create".
        <ul>
            <li>You can also click "Create" to the right of the Filter option.</li>

    <li>Select the field you wish to add to your filter as well as the condition and matching criteria.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Note</strong>: Only fields you have view access for will be available to add in the Filter list.</li>
            <li>For Integer type fields (e.g. case number), you can select the "is any of" operator to pull up records that match any one of the set values (e.g. 100, 200, 300, etc.) in the search criteria.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>To add multiple fields to the new filter, click the Plus button to the right of the filter.
        <ul>
            <li>To remove fields from the new filter, click the Minus button to the right of the filter.</li>
            <li>To clear any filter values (e.g. Will Westin), simply click the "x" to the right of the value or select "Reset" to the left of the Save button.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b5cef19d-9bfa-2809-da59-5503077b6a8c.png" alt="" width="516" height="269" /></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>The list view will automatically display results matching your filters as you create and modify the criteria.</p>
<h4 id="c80000-65f1-5acc-dfc3-551b22f01ba2_Saving_a_Filter">Saving a Filter</h4>

<h3 id="c80000-65f1-5acc-dfc3-551b22f01ba2_Subpanels">Subpanels</h3>
<p>Beneath a case record's fields are subpanels containing related records from various modules, communication history regarding the case, and what contacts to work with regarding the case. Selecting the Data View button will display the subpanels rather than the record's activity stream.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d5470afe-3db8-a192-a271-550307c5870c.png" alt="" height="188" width="613" /></p>
<h4 id="c80000-65f1-5acc-dfc3-551b22f01ba2_Filter_Options">Filter Options</h4>
<p>While in Data View, all of the case record's related records will be displayed beneath the case record's fields. Users have the ability to search for records which appear in the subpanels as well as filter the view to only display a specific module (e.g. Contacts, Tasks, etc.). To locate a record by name, enter the keyword into the Search bar, and the subpanel(s) with the matching record(s) will appear below. To filter, simply click the Related option to the far left of the Search bar and select the module whose subpanel you wish to view. Filter and search may be combined to only display matching records within a selected module. To see all subpanels to which you have access, simply select "All" in the Related options and remove any text from the search bar. When you run a search using a saved or created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the page. Returning to the page will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/2ca91ac6-a626-b9f9-3fad-55030767b0ea.png" alt="" height="148" width="554" /></p>
<p>When a Sidecar module (e.g. Contacts, Tasks, etc.) is selected from the Related options, you have the option to filter the related subpanels further using one of the available options (e.g. My Favorites, Recently Created, etc.). Please note that you can also create custom filters for related Sidecar modules. Once the related module (e.g. Contacts) is selected, either click the Filter option and select "Create" or click "Create" to the right of the Filter option. For more information on creating a related records filter, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Creating_a_Related_Records_Filter">Creating a Related Records Filter</a> section of the Search documentation.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/73801e27-fe1f-3daa-02f1-5503079f2c32.png" alt="" height="220" width="546" /></p>
<h4 id="c80000-65f1-5acc-dfc3-551b22f01ba2_Reordering_Subpanels">Reordering Subpanels</h4>
<p>Users can easily move subpanels to a new location on the record view by dragging and dropping the subpanel's header. The new subpanel order will remain for a user upon subsequent visits to the module until the user's browser cache is cleared. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/cbafe0dc-a1d3-06ed-571e-550304afa317.png" alt="Reordering_Subpanels" width="678" height="327" /></p>
<h4 id="c80000-65f1-5acc-dfc3-551b22f01ba2_Related_Record_Subpanels">Related Record Subpanels</h4>
<p>The most common type of subpanels displayed on a case's record view contain the case's related records belonging to various modules. The relationship type determines whether a related record will be displayed in the field listing or in a subpanel. For example, a case may be related to multiple notes, which means that the related notes will be displayed in the subpanel beneath the fields.</p>
<p>Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to change the fields (e.g. Subject, Assigned User, etc.) and labels of each subpanel by configuring the layout via Admin &gt; Studio to provide visibility to the most important fields. For more information on modifying subpanels, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Editing_Subpanels">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<p>Related record subpanels allow the following operations to be performed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To view the details of a related record, click the record's name in the subpanel to open it in record view.</li>
    <li>To relate an existing record to the case, choose "Link Existing Record" from the subpanel's Action menu, then locate and select the desired record.</li>
    <li>To relate a new record to the case, click the Plus button to the left of the Actions menu, then complete the record view layout and click "Save".</li>
    <li>To preview the related record, click the Preview icon to the far right of the record's row in the subpanel.</li>
    <li>To inline edit the record directly from the subpanel, choose "Edit" from the Actions menu on the far right of the record's row and click "Save" to preserve the change.</li>
    <li>To delete the case's relationship to a record, choose "Unlink" from the Actions menu on the far right of the record's row. This removes the relationship, but does not delete the record itself.</li>
    <li>To mark the record as a favorite, click the star icon to the left of the desired record's row.</li>
    <li>To collapse or expand the subpanel, click the Up arrow to the left of the Plus button.</li>
    <li>To change the column size in the subpanel, place your cursor on the column divider and when the Left and Right arrow appears, click and drag the column to the desired size. Please note that the column width will not be preserved when you navigate away from the page.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="c80000-65f1-5acc-dfc3-551b22f01ba2_Emails_Subpanel">Emails Subpanel</h4>
<p>The Emails subpanel in the Cases module displays both emails implicitly and explicitly related to the case record in addition to emails from its related contact records. Please note that any incoming emails must contain the case number (e.g. [CASE:100]) in the subject line in order for the email to appear in the Emails subpanel. Emails in Sugar are implicitly related to records in Sugar that match an email address in the From, To, or Cc fields in the email. This implicit relationship is made for emails sent from Sugar as well as any email imported into Sugar via Inbound email accounts or email archiving. While composing an email or relating an existing email to a record, users have the ability to set an explicit relationship via the flex relate field by <a href="#e06b545-5f8a-348a-a1db-556e3f1b53ba_Relating_Emails">Relating Emails</a>. This allows the email to be explicitly related to a single record from one of many modules.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Administrators can enable or disable emails from related contacts from appearing in the Emails subpanel and History dashlet via Admin &gt; Related Contacts Emails. For more information regarding enabling and disabling related contacts emails, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/06_Email/#Related_Contacts_Emails">Related Contacts Emails</a> section of the Emails documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<p>The Emails subpanel allows the following functions to be performed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To view the details of an email, click the subject in the subpanel to open it in detail view.</li>
    <li>Minimize the subpanel by clicking "^" (up arrow).</li>
    <li>Expand the subpanel by clicking "v" (down arrow).</li>
    <li>Click "+" to create a new email that will have an implicit relationship with this record.</li>
    <li>Sort the emails by Subject, Status, Date Created, Date Modified, or Assigned User.</li>

<h2 id="c80000-65f1-5acc-dfc3-551b22f01ba2_Finding_Duplicate_Cases">Finding Duplicate Cases</h2>
<p>Between multiple users working in Sugar, importing new records, and converting leads, it is possible for duplicate note records to be accidentally input to the system. Before creating a new note record, a good practice is to first check that the note does not already exist in Sugar. You can locate duplicate records for cleanup using <a href="#c80000-65f1-5acc-dfc3-551b22f01ba2_Module_Search">module search</a> from the Notes list view. Searching for notes with similar names or other information can turn search into a powerful, duplicates-finding tool. Sugar also provides a wizard for finding potential duplicates that is available from the Notes record view and may be used as shown below. If duplicate note records are detected, you can perform a merge per the <a href="#c80000-65f1-5acc-dfc3-551b22f01ba2_Merging_Cases">Merging Cases</a> section of this documentation.</p>
<p>Please note that your ability to use the Find Duplicates action may be restricted by any role which prevents note deletion. For more information on roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide. Check with your system administrator if you do not see the Find Duplicates option.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to locate duplicate notes using the Find Duplicates option from the Notes record view:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to an note's record view.</li>
    <li>Choose "Find Duplicates" from the Actions menu. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8a25759a-bf25-1340-674a-550307e331a1.png" alt="" width="500" height="192" /></li>
    <li>Potential duplicate note records will be listed on the Find Duplicates page. Select the duplicate record(s) you wish to merge then click "Merge Duplicates".
        <ul>
            <li>You can preview the duplicate record's details by clicking the Preview button to the far right of the records row.</li>
            <li>You can search for specific records from the Notes list view if you wish to check for more possible duplicates. For more information on performing a search, please refer to the <a href="#c80000-65f1-5acc-dfc3-551b22f01ba2_Module_Search">Module Search</a> section of this documentation.</li>
            <li>You can also click the Column Selection icon above the Preview button to change the list of fields that display on the list view column headers.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

<p>Once you click "Merge Duplicates", the merging process with the current record will begin. For instructions on performing the merge that follows, please refer to Steps 3-9 of the <a href="#c80000-65f1-5acc-dfc3-551b22f01ba2_Merging_Via_List_View">Merging Via List View</a> section of this documentation.</p>
<h2 id="c80000-65f1-5acc-dfc3-551b22f01ba2_Merging_Cases">Merging Cases</h2>
<p>When duplicate records are identified in Sugar, you have the option to merge two or more cases into a single record. Once the merge is complete, the duplicate case record(s) will be deleted, and the primary record will remain. Please note that all relationships belonging to the duplicate cases will be merged to the primary record meaning that any calls, meetings, contacts, etc. related to the duplicate case record(s) will automatically be related to the resulting, merged case record.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Date Created, Date Modified, and Password field types are not supported when merging duplicate records in Sugar.</p>

<p><a href="#c80000-65f1-5acc-dfc3-551b22f01ba2_Module_Search">Module Search</a> may be used to identify duplicate cases by, for example, searching for cases with similar names or related accounts. Once your search has identified duplicate cases, you can merge them directly from the Cases list view.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to merge cases via the list view:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Use the list view's <a href="#c80000-65f1-5acc-dfc3-551b22f01ba2_Module_Search">Module Search</a> to identify duplicate cases.</li>
    <li>Possible duplicates will be displayed in the list view. Select the duplicate record(s) that you wish to merge.
        <ul>
            <li>Please note that up to five records may be merged at once in Sugar. An error message ("Invalid number of records passed. The valid range is from 2 to 5 records.") will appear if more than five records are selected when attempting to perform a merge.</li>
        </ul>

    </li>
    <li>Select "Merge" from the Actions menu to display the Merging Records page. The primary record's field values are displayed on the left while other record's values are in columns to the right. For convenience, fields with differing values will appear on the top of the list. Saving the merge will preserve only the field values marked with the radio button into a single record.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/364ee942-416d-be76-a26d-550307943031.png" alt="" width="650" height="235" /><br />If 3 or more records are selected to be merged, an X icon will appear at the top right of each record. Clicking the "X" will remove the record from the merge process but will not delete the record.</li>
    <li>To change which record is considered the primary, drag and drop the Primary label on the top of a different column.</li>

<h2 id="c80000-65f1-5acc-dfc3-551b22f01ba2_Communicating_Regarding_Cases">Communicating Regarding Cases</h2>
<p>Sugar includes the functionality to allow users to communicate with customers and keep an archive of communication between a support representative and the customer with regards to cases. Communication regarding cases can be performed via emails and via the Case Portal and Cases module.</p>
<p>When using email communication, please note that administrators in Sugar must first configure the outbound mail server for the system via Admin &gt; Email Settings in order for users to send outbound emails. For more information on setting up the system email settings, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/06_Email#Email_Settings">Email</a> documentation in the Administration guide. Users will also need to have their email settings configured in their user preferences prior to sending outbound email from the Emails module or Cases module. For more information on setting up your user preferences' email settings, please refer to the <a href="#e-543f-551b22c2c01c___Email_Settings">Getting Started</a> documentation.</p>
<h3 id="c80000-65f1-5acc-dfc3-551b22f01ba2_Communicating_Via_Emails">Communicating Via Emails</h3>
<p>Sugar allows emails to be archived to cases and visible in the <a href="#d03d1-d6ae-25ce-a8e4-551b225ee8d6_History_Dashlet">History Dashlet</a> regardless of them being sent and received in Sugar directly. When an email is received by Sugar, using either Inbound Email or Email Archiving, Sugar will utilize a Case Macro to relate the email. The Case Macro is placed in the subject line of the email and contains the case number that the email should be related to. Case Macros are configurable by an administrator via Admin &gt; Inbound Email, but will typically use the standard format of [CASE:##] to be placed in the subject line. For more information on configuring the case macro, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/06_Email#Modifying_the_Case_Macro">Inbound Email</a> documentation. The formatting of the macro is imperative for Sugar to properly read the subject of the email for import. For example, a proper subject line with the macro will be: "[CASE:125] System not responding".</p>
<p>One way that the emails can be received in Sugar to use the case macro is through a monitored inbound mailbox. This is a mailbox on your company's mail server that Sugar is granted the ability to read. For example, this would function where an email is sent from to <span>support@mycompany.com</span> and includes a proper case macro. Sugar would then poll the mailbox, find the case macro, and associate the email to the specified case in the macro. This can also be used by support representatives who are directly emailing with a customer. The group mailbox can be CC'd and, using the case macro, have the email thread archived. For more information on configuring an inbound email box, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/06_Email#Creating_Group_Mail_Accounts">Inbound Email</a> documentation.</p>
<p>The other option that users have to archive emails is using Sugar's Email Archiving functionality. Email Archiving must be configured and enabled by administrators in Sugar via Admin &gt; Email Settings. Once configured, an email address will be generated that is specific to your instance of Sugar. When this email address receives an email, it scans the email for any email addresses. The email is then imported into Sugar, where the email is associated to any contact, lead, etc. containing an email address on the email. When including the case macro on the email, Sugar will also import this email to the referenced case. For more information on setting up Email Archiving, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/06_Email#Email_Archiving">Email Archiving</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<h3 id="c80000-65f1-5acc-dfc3-551b22f01ba2_Communicating_Via_Portal">Communicating Via Portal</h3>
<p>The Case Portal can be used to both view and submit cases from a customer to a support department, but can also be used as a method of communication regarding a case. Both customers and Sugar users have the option to add notes to cases. Users can do this via the <a href="#d03d1-d6ae-25ce-a8e4-551b225ee8d6_History_Dashlet">History Dashlet</a> . Customers have this as an available option when viewing the details of a case. For more information on using the Case Portal, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Portal_Deployment_User_Guide#Adding_Notes_and_Attachments_to_Cases">Portal Deployment User Guide</a> . When a customer adds a note to the portal, the note will be available for viewing inside Sugar. Alternately, when a user adds a note to a case from Sugar and the "Display in Portal?" checkbox is selected on the note, the note will be available to view in the portal. These notes are visible by anyone tied to the account that the case is associated to and with access to the support portal. For more information on the Notes module, please review the <a href="#d706ba-5a49-27d4-53ac-551b22e7be1b_Notes">Notes</a> documentation.</p>

    <h2 id="d55-9587-e214-6e91-551b22e82de7_Creating_Articles">Creating Articles</h2>
    <p>There are a few methods for creating articles in Sugar including via the Knowledge Base module, duplication, and from a case record. The edit view layout opens when creating the article directly from the Knowledge Base menu and includes all of the relevant fields for your organization's articles.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Draft</strong> : The article is still undergoing changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Expired</strong> : The article is outdated.</li>
        <li><strong>In Review </strong>: The article is being reviewed by the designated approver. When this status is set a notification email is sent to the Approver.</li>
        <li><strong>Published</strong> : The article is finished.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In order for an article to be visible through the Sugar Portal, the article must meet all of the following requirements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>External Article = Checked</li>
        <li>Status = Published</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If any one of these conditions is not met, the article will not be visible through the Sugar Portal.</p>
    <h3 id="d55-9587-e214-6e91-551b22e82de7_Creating_Via_Knowledge_Base_Module">Creating Via Knowledge Base Module</h3>
    <p>One of the most common methods of article creation is via the Create Article option in the Knowledge Base module tab. This opens up the edit view layout which allows you to enter in all the relevant information for the article. <br /> Use the following steps to create an article via the Knowledge Base module:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click the triangle in the Knowledge Base module tab and select "Create Article".<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/de51ea39-ec68-f8e8-7141-55521fc6a224.png" alt="KB KnowledgeBase ModuleTab CreateArticle New" width="427" height="141" /></li>
        <li>Enter appropriate values for the fields in the edit view layout. Fields marked with a red asterisk as well as the article body are required and must be completed prior to saving.</li>
        <li>Once the necessary information is entered, click "Save". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/69b817e4-ab70-a1e8-ae83-5503045977e0.png" alt="" width="266" height="189" /></li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="d55-9587-e214-6e91-551b22e82de7_Creating_Via_Duplication">Creating Via Duplication</h3>
    <p>You can also create a new article by duplicating an existing article. The duplicate option is useful if the article you are creating has similar information to an existing article. <br /><strong>Note</strong>: Article tags do not copy over to the new article. <br /> Use the following steps to create an article by duplicating an existing record:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Navigate to an article's detail view.</li>
        <li>Click the Actions menu and select "Copy". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/be210627-9c78-fca8-7228-55512ea693fd.png" alt="KB ActionsMenu Copy New" width="371" height="170" /></li>
        <li>The displayed edit view is pre-populated with the original article's values. Update the necessary fields, then click "Save". <br /><strong>Note</strong>: Duplicating a published article will default the new article to a status of "Draft". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/f33bb9b8-17ec-7265-7ac1-55030400973f.png" alt="" width="299" height="169" /></li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="d55-9587-e214-6e91-551b22e82de7_Creating_Via_Cases">Creating Via Cases</h3>
    <p>Sugar enables you to transfer details from a case record to create a knowledge base article. This is designed for situations where a case has documented a resolution to a problem. Creating an article from such records enables the user to share the information with other users without manually copying or duplicating the information. A new article is created using the subject of the case as the title of the article. The body of the new article is automatically populated with the case number, subject, description, and resolution from the case. For more information on creating and modifying cases, please refer to the <a href="#c80000-65f1-5acc-dfc3-551b22f01ba2_Creating_Cases">Cases</a> documentation. <br /> Use the following steps to create an article from a case:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Navigate to a case's record view.</li>
        <li>Select "Create Article" from the Actions menu. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b781467e-a0bd-63e4-d15a-55513928fd9d.png" alt="KB Cases RecordView ActionsMenu CreateArticle New" width="475" height="116" /></li>
        <li>Update the necessary fields, then click "Save". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/1a6ddaa5-9fc6-4643-c676-550304492900.png" alt="" width="287" height="164" /></li>

    <h2 id="d55-9587-e214-6e91-551b22e82de7_Searching_Articles">Searching Articles</h2>
    <p>The Knowledge Base list view includes a Basic and Advanced Search to help you locate records easily and effectively in a module-specific manner. Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Knowledge Base list view below. Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module.</p>
    <h3 id="d55-9587-e214-6e91-551b22e82de7_Basic_Search">Basic Search</h3>
    <p>The Basic Search in the Knowledge Base module utilizes the Full Text search built into the database. This is enabled and configured by default for On-Demand instances and On-Site instances running MySQL. For more information on how to enable Full Text search on MSSQL for On-Site instances, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/13_Knowledge_Base_Administration#Enabling_Search_on_MSSQL">Enabling Search on MSSQL</a> section in the Knowledge Base Administration documentation in the Administration guide. <br /> Basic Search offers a keyword search as well as a category option.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b6e98d14-41ff-f9e7-9cd5-555235057123.png" alt="KB BasicSearch New" width="519" height="172" /></p>
    <p>The keyword search uses syntax understood by the database sugar is running on and searches the full text index of the body of the article. Click the "i" icon to get some guidance on the syntax used for keyword searches. <br /> The syntax listed below is specifically for MySQL although many, if not all, of these features will work on MSSQL as well:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Case </strong><strong>Insensitive</strong> : Searching for "device" will locate articles that contain "Device" as well.</li>
        <li><strong>Phrase Search</strong> : Phrases can be searched, but must be enclosed by double quotes (e.g. "the settings screen").</li>
        <li><strong>Multiple Keywords</strong> : Search for multiple keywords by separating them with a space. Sugar assumes an "or" operator between the words. For example : Search for "battery device" will find any article that contains the word "battery" or the word "device".</li>
        <li><strong>Require Words or Phrases</strong> : To require a word or phrase in your results the word or phrase should be preceded by a plus sign (+). For example : Search for "+battery +device" will find any article that has the word "battery" and the word "device".</li>
        <li><strong>Exclude Words or Phrases</strong> : To exclude a word or phrase in your results the word or phrase should be preceded by a minus sign (-). For example : Search for "+device -internet" will find any article that has the word "device" but does not have the word "internet".</li>
        <li><strong>Wildcards</strong> : Use an asterisk (*) to have your keyword return a partial match. For example : Search for "batt*" will return any article that contains a word that start with batt (e.g. battery).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Note: </strong>Words that contain three or less letters are treated as stop words in MySQL, unless they are part of a phrase. Hence, the search results will not display articles containing such words. There is also a list of default stop words that MySQL will exclude from Full Text Searching. For the complete list of default stop words in MySQL 5.5, please refer to the MySQL documentation location here: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/fulltext-stopwords.html. <br /> In addition to the keyword search you can also select a category to perform the search in. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/99a98d39-d695-f3cd-ba6a-550304cd104c.png" alt="" width="472" height="118" /><br /> The categories included by default are the following :</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>All</strong> : Searches all articles.</li>
        <li><strong>Added Last 30 days</strong> : Searches any articles created within the last 30 days.</li>
        <li><strong>Pending my Approval</strong> : Searches any articles that have a status of "In Review" and the Approver are set to the current user.</li>
        <li><strong>Updated Last 30 days</strong> : Searches any articles modified within the last 30 days.</li>
        <li><strong>FAQs</strong> : Searches any articles currently set to the FAQ tag.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can use the category search in coordination with the keyword search in order to find any articles containing the keyword that also matches one of the categories. Once the search is complete, the relevant results will populate in the list view below the search panel. To see all articles to which you have access, simply click "Clear" and then "Search" to perform a blank search with no filters. Please note that you will only be able to see articles as allowed by your team membership, user access type, and assigned roles. For more information on teams and roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/031_Team_Management">Team Management</a> and <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
    <h3 id="d55-9587-e214-6e91-551b22e82de7_Advanced_Search">Advanced Search</h3>
    <p>Advanced Search offers a more in-depth search experience than Basic Search including additional fields and saved search capability. From the Advanced search panel, you can click "Search" for simplified searching. <br /><br /> The buttons, checkboxes, and dropdowns available in Advanced Search have the following functions:<img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/eee2d734-3546-8bfe-172e-55523ae125d9.png" alt="KB AdvSearch New" width="823" height="389" /></p>

        <li><strong>Clear</strong> : Click the Clear button to clear all criteria from the searchable fields.</li>
        <li><strong>Saved Searches</strong> : Save, recall, update, and delete searches which you use often. For more information, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Saved_Search">Saved Search</a> section of the Search documentation.</li>
        <li><strong>Containing these words</strong> : Enter one or more keywords or phrases. Use a space to separate keywords from each other. Use quotes to enclose a phrase. <br /><strong>Note</strong>: The plus sign (+) mentioned in Basic Search is not required in this section.</li>
        <li><strong>Search within</strong> : Select the category to filter the results by (e.g. All, Added last 30 days, etc.).</li>
        <li><strong>Excluding these words</strong> : Enter one or more keywords or phrases to exclude from the search. Use a space to separate keywords or phrases from each other. <br /><strong>Note</strong>: The minus sign (-) mentioned in Basic Search is not required in this section.</li>
        <li><strong>Using This Tag</strong> : Enter the tag name or click "Select" to choose the tag from the Tags list.</li>
        <li><strong>Title</strong> : Enter a title name. Please note that Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase.</li>
        <li><strong>Viewing Frequency</strong> : Select the frequency category to filter the results by (e.g. Top 5, Top 10, Bottom 5, etc.).</li>
        <li><strong>Status</strong> : Select the status to filter the results by (e.g. Draft, Expired, In Review, or Published).</li>
        <li><strong>Team</strong> : Enter the team name or click "Select" to choose the team from the Teams list.</li>
        <li><strong>Approved By</strong> : Enter the person's name or click "Select" to choose a user from the Users list to see articles approved by a specific user.</li>
        <li><strong>Author</strong> : Enter the person's name or click "Select" to choose a user from the Users list to see articles authored or assigned to a specific user.</li>
        <li><strong>Published</strong> : Select an option from the dropdown to filter articles by published date (e.g. On a specific date, Is Between two specific dates, Last 7 days, etc.).</li>
        <li><strong>Expires</strong> : Select an option from the dropdown to filter articles by expires date (e.g. On a specific date, Is Between two specific dates, Last 7 days, etc.).</li>
        <li><strong>Attachments</strong> : Select an option from the dropdown to filter articles with or without attachments. You can also search using criteria like Mime Type and Attachment name.</li>
        <li><strong>External Article?</strong> : Select this checkbox to search for external articles.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you run a search, Sugar will return records matching all (as opposed to any) of the fields for which you have given a value. For example, if you select "External Article?" and enter in a title to search, Sugar will only return articles with a matching title that are marked as external. Once the search completes, the relevant results will populate in the list view below the search panel. To see all articles to which you have access, simply click "Clear" and then "Search" to perform a blank search with no filters. Please note that you will only be able to see articles as allowed by your team membership, user access type, and assigned roles.

    <h3 id="d55-9587-e214-6e91-551b22e82de7_Global_Search">Global Search</h3>
    <p>Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Beginning with version 6.5.0, Full Text Search may be used with Global Search to search throughout nearly all fields and modules for an enhanced search experience. The Global Search bar is located on the top right hand side of Sugar. You can click the magnifying glass icon or hit Return/Enter to perform your search once the text string is entered in the search box.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/935b7016-deab-6fef-f16d-550304095d5e.png" width="380" height="48" alt="935b7016-deab-6fef-f16d-550304095d5e.png" /><br /> To use global search, you need to first enter the keyword into the search box and the pop-up results will begin appearing once you enter in at least one character. Clicking the magnifying glass icon or hitting your Return/Enter key will cause Sugar to return exact matches for your keyword rather than matches with words beginning with your keyword. For more information on using and configuring Global Search, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Global_Search">Global Search</a> section of the Search documentation. <br /> Regular Sugar users can configure some aspects of global search such as what modules are displayed in the search results by clicking the down arrow within the Search box then selecting the module(s) to include in the search.

    <p>List view displays the current search results broken into pages that you can scroll through rather than displaying potentially thousands of rows at once. To the right just below the search panel you can see which records of the total results set are currently being displayed. The two single-arrow Next and Previous buttons can be used to scroll through the records page-by-page. The two double-arrow First Page and Last Page buttons allow you to skip to the beginning or the end of your current results. <br /> By default, Sugar displays 20 records per list view page, but administrators can change the number of records displayed via Admin &gt; System Settings. For more information on changing the number of displayed records, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/05_System#User_Interface">System</a> documentation in the Administration guide. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5bab8f70-dc1c-2d08-585f-5503026c81e3.png" alt="" width="516" height="160" /></p>

    <h2 id="d55-9587-e214-6e91-551b22e82de7_Exporting_Articles">Exporting Articles</h2>
    <p>Sugar's Export option allows users to download all fields for articles to their computers as a .CSV (comma-separated values) file. This may be useful when needing to use article data with other software such as Microsoft Excel. Due to PHP memory limitations on the server, there may be occasions when the application times out while exporting a large number of articles. If you encounter an error when performing this action, we recommend selecting the records in smaller batches.</p>
    <p>Users with access to the Reports module have the option of creating or accessing reports containing specifically chosen fields for articles and their related record(s). Please note that only Rows and Columns-type reports have the ability to be exported. For more information on exporting records in Sugar, please refer to the <a href="#e6004c-15af-3450-3b7e-551b22bbe5d2_Export">Export</a> documentation. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/75c4b96e-51af-e585-10e4-555137bb5eb6.png" alt="KB Reports Export New" width="420" height="253" /><br /> Please note that your ability to export articles from Sugar may be restricted by a role.

    <h2 id="d55-9587-e214-6e91-551b22e82de7_Tags">Tags</h2>
    <p>Tags are similar to folders and enable you to categorize articles according to specific criteria, such as a topic, to make locating articles easier. When you tag an article, the system creates a link between the tag and the article which resides in the Sugar database. An article can be linked with more than one tag. Similarly, a tag can be linked with multiple articles. Tags can be parent tags or child tags. Parent tags are the top most category and child tags are nested within parent tags.</p>
    <h3 id="d55-9587-e214-6e91-551b22e82de7_Creating_Tags">Creating Tags</h3>
    <p>Administrative users can create tags from the Knowledge Base Administration page. For more information on how to create tags from Knowledge Base Administration please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/13_Knowledge_Base_Administration#Creating_New_Tags">Knowledge Base Administration</a> document in the administration guide. Users who do not have admin or developer access can create tags while creating or editing an article. <br /> Use the following steps to create a tag while creating or editing an article:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>From the article's edit view, click "Select" in the Tags field. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/bc9e83be-8c46-888f-6b63-5503045dd645.png" alt="" width="338" height="119" /></li>
        <li>This opens up the tags dialog box where you can search and select existing tags. Click "Create New Tag". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/15b6a2d6-2afb-a51e-4c65-5503042d252a.png" alt="" width="361" height="265" /><br /><strong>Note</strong>: The numbers next to the tag name indicate the number of articles currently tagged.</li>
        <li>The dialog then prompts you to select a parent tag. Click any tag in the tree to nest the new tag underneath. If the tag you are creating should be a new parent tag, select "Tags" in the tree to add the new tag to the same level as the other parent tags. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/52e50af2-fc67-85d4-c538-550304db0443.png" alt="" width="288" height="296" /></li>

        <li>The tags dialog box remains open for you to continue creating new tags, or select the appropriate tag to add it to the article.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="d55-9587-e214-6e91-551b22e82de7_Deleting_Tags">Deleting Tags</h3>
    <p>Administrative users can delete tags entirely from the system, but only if the tag does not have any articles assigned to it. For more information on how to delete tags from Sugar, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/13_Knowledge_Base_Administration#Deleting_Tags">Knowledge Base Administration</a> documentation in the administration guide. Users who do not have admin or developer access can delete a tag off of an article while creating or editing an article. <br /> Use the following steps to delete a tag from an article while creating or editing the article:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>From the article's edit view, click the trash can icon in the Tags field next to the tag you wish to remove. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/513fdc0a-ffbb-eb56-d80c-550304a9d356.png" alt="" width="332" height="172" /></li>
        <li>If you have added the tag during this edit of the article, the trash icon is replaced with a minus icon.</li>
        <li>Once the necessary tags have been removed, click "Save".</li>

<h2 id="d232-2535-ee9d-551b224cd50c_Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Sugar's Bugs module is used to track and manage product related problems, commonly referred to as bugs or defects, either found internally or reported by customers. The bugs can be further triaged by tracking the found and fixed in release. The Bugs module gives users a way to quickly review all details of the bug and the process being used to rectify it. Once a bug is created or submitted, you can view and edit information pertaining to the bug via the Bug's record view. Each bug record may then relate to other Sugar records such as calls, contacts, cases, and many others. This documentation will cover how to use the Bugs module as well as the various actions and options available from within the module.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This module is hidden by default. The administrator must display it for your use.</p>
<h2 id="d232-2535-ee9d-551b224cd50c_Bug_Fields">Bug Fields</h2>
<p>The Bugs module contains a number of stock fields which come out-of-the-box with Sugar. The below definitions are suggested meanings for the fields, but the fields can be leveraged differently to best meet your organization's needs. Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to alter, add, or remove fields via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on configuring fields, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Fields">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

<h2 id="d232-2535-ee9d-551b224cd50c_Creating_Bugs">Creating Bugs</h2>
<p>There are various methods for reporting bugs in Sugar including via the Bugs module, quick create, duplication, and importing bugs. Customers can also submit bug reports via the Bug Portal. The full record view layout opens when creating the bug report directly from the Bugs menu and includes all of the relevant fields for your organization's bugs. The quick create form is a shortened version of the bugs record view and typically contains fewer fields. When using quick create to submit a bug while viewing an existing record of another module, Sugar automatically creates a relationship between both records. For example, if you are viewing a case record and create a new bug report via the quick create form, the Cases subpanel in the bug record will automatically populate with the case you were working on, thus creating the relationship. Both the record view and quick create layouts can be configured by administrators via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on configuring layouts, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Layouts">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<h3 id="d232-2535-ee9d-551b224cd50c_Creating_Via_Bugs_Module">Creating Via Bugs Module</h3>

<h3 id="d232-2535-ee9d-551b224cd50c_Creating_Via_Duplication">Creating Via Duplication</h3>
<p>You can also create a new bug report by duplicating an existing bug. The copy option is useful if the bug you are creating has similar information to an existing bug, such as similar reproduction steps, or you are creating it to tie it to a different version of your product.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to create a bug by duplicating an existing record:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to a bug record's record view.</li>
    <li>Click the Actions menu and select "Copy". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/63d103e4-48c9-2eac-5915-550308b9e7f7.png" alt="" width="489" height="217" /></li>
    <li>The displayed record view is pre-populated with the original bug's values. Update the necessary fields, then click "Save". <br /><strong>Note</strong>: The bug number is not duplicated and a unique number is generated upon saving the duplicate bug record.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Alternatively, you can use the Actions Menu to the right of the Save button to select "Save and view" or "Save and create new". "Save and view" will display the record's details after the save is complete. "Save and create new" saves the current record and opens a new, blank record view in edit mode where you can create another record.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

<h2 id="d232-2535-ee9d-551b224cd50c_Searching_Bugs">Searching Bugs</h2>
<p>The Bugs list view includes a module search to help you locate records easily and effectively in a module-specific manner. Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Bugs list view below. Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Please note that Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %smith). This will pull up any record that has the word "smith" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p>
<p>For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Search">Search</a> documentation.</p>
<h3 id="d232-2535-ee9d-551b224cd50c_Module_Search">Module Search</h3>
<p>Module search enables users to easily search by bug number within the Bugs module and pull up matching records in the list view. The search also provides a Filter option which can be used in combination with the open Search box to narrow your search further using the available options as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Create</strong> : Create a new custom filter which you can use to filter your search
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Note</strong>: You can also click "Create" to the right of the Filter option.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>All Bugs</strong> : Returns all records in the module to which you have access</li>
    <li><strong>My Bugs </strong>: Returns only records assigned to you</li>
    <li><strong>My Favorites</strong> : Returns only records you have marked as favorites</li>
    <li><strong>Recently Created</strong> : Returns only records you created in the module within the last 7 days</li>
    <li><strong>Recently Viewed </strong>: Returns only records you have viewed in the module within the last 7 days</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8f2c1b5f-1291-e387-49f0-550308e99984.png" alt="" height="264" width="460" /></p>
<p>When you choose a filter, Sugar will return bugs which match both the selected filter and any name provided in the "Search by subject, number..." bar in the filtered list view results. For example, if you select "My Bugs" in the Filter options and enter a bug name, Sugar will only return bug records with a matching name that are assigned to you. Once the search is complete, the relevant results will populate in the <a href="#d232-2535-ee9d-551b224cd50c_Bugs_List_View">list view</a> below the search bar. To see all bug records to which you have access, simply select the All Bugs option in the filter and remove any text from the search bar. You can also click the Clear icon within the selected filter option (e.g. My Bugs) in the Search bar to clear the filter and pull up all list view search results. When you run a search using a saved or created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/2d8a1625-a6d6-36f6-d8d1-550308b5702e.png" alt="" height="156" width="286" /></p>
<p>Please note that you will only be able to see bug records as allowed by your team membership, user access type, and assigned roles. For more information on teams and roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/031_Team_Management">Teams</a> and <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Roles</a> management documentation in the Administration guide.

<p>Users can also create new filters via the Create option in the Filter list of the search bar. This allows users to add custom, complex filter options when searching in the Bugs list view. You have the option to add multiple fields to your new filter by clicking the Plus button to the right of the filter selection dropdown lists and set select operators along with their value(s). A filter's criteria need to be true for a record in order for it to appear in the list view search result. Additionally, filters with no specified values may be saved as a custom filter to act as a filter template when a user often searches using the same fields but with varying values. Please note that only fields you have view access for will appear in the Filter list when creating a search filter.</p>
<p>When you run a search using a created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away</p>
<p>The following steps cover creating a new Assigned to filter as an example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click the Filter option on the Bugs search bar then select "Create".

<h3 id="d232-2535-ee9d-551b224cd50c_Global_Search">Global Search</h3>
<p>Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Sugar database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Beginning with version 6.5.0, Full Text Search may be used with Global Search to search throughout nearly all fields and modules for an enhanced search experience. The Global Search bar is located on the top right hand side of Sugar. You can click the magnifying glass icon or hit Return/Enter to perform your search once the text string is entered in the search box.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/ed6ddee1-f977-be6c-9e1f-550308f6a0f3.png" alt="" width="300" height="40" /></p>
<p>To use global search, you need to first enter the keyword into the search box and the pop-up results will begin appearing once you enter in at least one character. Clicking the magnifying glass icon or hitting your Return/Enter key will cause Sugar to return exact matches for your keyword rather than matches with words beginning with your keyword. For more information on using and configuring Global Search, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Global_Search">Global Search</a> section of the Search documentation.</p>
<p>Regular Sugar users can configure some aspects of global search such as what modules are displayed in the search results by clicking the down arrow within the Search box then selecting the module(s) to include in the search. For more information on configuring your Global Search, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Advanced_Options">Search</a> documentation. Administrators can control additional elements of global search via Admin &gt; Search and Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on administrator configuration of Global Search, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Field_Options">Field Options </a>section of the Studio documentation as well as the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/05_System#Search">Search</a> section of the System documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

<p>Users have the option to mark bug records as a favorite via the record view as well as the list view. This allows users to designate records that are important or will be viewed often so that they can easily be accessed via search or from the Bugs module tab. In the Bugs record view, the star on the right of the bug's subject is yellow once marked to indicate a favorite bug. For more information on how to mark records as favorites, please refer to the <a href="#d232-2535-ee9d-551b224cd50c_Favoriting_Bugs">Favoriting Bugs</a> section of this documentation.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/847f8085-8426-1730-c084-5503086a52a9.png" alt="" width="275" height="49" /></p>
<h3 id="d232-2535-ee9d-551b224cd50c_Following_Designation">Following Designation</h3>
<p>Users also have the option to follow bug records via the record view or list view. This allows users to view record posts from followed bugs on their Home page and Bugs list view activity stream. Each user can personalize their activity streams by viewing posts for records that are most important to them. From the record view, users may follow or unfollow bugs to which they have access using the Follow button to the right of the bug's name. For more information on how to mark records to follow via the list view, please refer to the <a href="#d232-2535-ee9d-551b224cd50c_Record_Actions_Menu">Record Actions Menu</a> section of this documentation. Please note that you will automatically follow records that you create as well as records that are assigned to you. You will not, however, automatically follow records you import. If you wish to stop following a specific bug record, click the Following button to revert it to gray. Should a user lose access to a record in Sugar, they will automatically stop following that record.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/6958ba5e-663d-e6a7-da73-550308f470b3.png" alt="" width="275" height="48" /></p>
<h3 id="d232-2535-ee9d-551b224cd50c_Next_or_Previous_Record">Next or Previous Record</h3>
<p>On the upper right of the Bugs record view, there are two buttons that allow you to page through each bug in the Bugs list view's current search results. Clicking the Previous button displays the previous bug report of the current search results while clicking the Next button displays the next bug report of the current search results.

<h3 id="d232-2535-ee9d-551b224cd50c_Show_More">Show More</h3>
<p>The Bugs record view typically display a few key fields (e.g. number, priority, type, category, etc.) on the business card panel with the option to view more fields by clicking the Show More link on the bottom left. Please note that administrators can configure what fields appear on the business card panel via Admin &gt; Studio. For more information on editing layouts, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Layouts">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/59f92a3d-a9f6-4378-3a7b-550308b606b2.png" alt="" width="350" height="299" /></p>
<h3 id="d232-2535-ee9d-551b224cd50c_Subpanels">Subpanels</h3>
<p>Beneath a bug report's fields are subpanels containing related records from various modules, communication history regarding the bug, documents and screen captures of the defect, and what customer cases are instances of the bug.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b82453b8-3f55-5601-7bbe-55030843a6e6.png" alt="" width="425" height="197" /></p>
<h4 id="d232-2535-ee9d-551b224cd50c_Filter_Options">Filter Options</h4>
<p>While in Data View, all of the bug record's related records will be displayed beneath the bug record's fields. Users have the ability to search for records which appear in the subpanels as well as filter the view to only display a specific module (e.g. Contacts, Cases, etc.). To locate a record by name, enter the keyword into the Search bar, and the subpanel(s) with the matching record(s) will appear below. To filter, simply click the Related option to the far left of the Search bar and select the module whose subpanel you wish to view. Filter and search may be combined to only display matching records within a selected module. To see all subpanels to which you have access, simply select "All" in the Related options and remove any text from the search bar. When you run a search using a saved or created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the page. Returning to the page will automatically display the results of your last filter. Please note that searches using the open Search box only are not preserved when navigating away.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/64083dec-a08b-48d9-8d1c-55030801f7f8.png" alt="" height="143" width="577" /></p>
<p>When a Sidecar module (e.g. Contacts, Accounts, Cases, etc.) is selected from the Related options, you have the option to filter the related subpanels further using one of the available options (e.g. My Favorites, Recently Created, etc.). Please note that you can also create custom filters for related Sidecar modules. Once the related module (e.g. Contacts) is selected, either click the Filter option and select "Create" or click "Create" to the right of the Filter option. For more information on creating related records filter, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Creating_a_Related_Records_Filter">Creating a Related Records Filter</a> section of the Search documentation.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b1ea67bd-f04e-bab9-c79b-550308e34c10.png" alt="" height="219" width="504" /></p>
<h4 id="d232-2535-ee9d-551b224cd50c_Reordering_Subpanels">Reordering Subpanels</h4>
<p>Users can easily move subpanels to a new location on the record view by dragging and dropping the subpanel's header. The new subpanel order will remain for a user upon subsequent visits to the module until the user's browser cache is cleared. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/cbafe0dc-a1d3-06ed-571e-550304afa317.png" alt="Reordering_Subpanels" width="692" height="334" /></p>
<h4 id="d232-2535-ee9d-551b224cd50c_Related_Module_Subpanels">Related Module Subpanels</h4>
<p>The most common type of subpanels displayed on a bug's record view contains the bug's related records belonging to various modules. The relationship type determines whether a related record will be displayed in the field listing or in a subpanel. Out of the box, the Bugs module does not include any relationships to other modules that would cause a related record to be displayed in the field listing. However, for example, a bug may be related to multiple cases. This means that the cases will be displayed in a subpanel beneath the fields listing.</p>
<p>Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to change the fields (e.g. Subject, Assigned User, etc.) and labels of each subpanel by configuring the layout via Admin &gt; Studio to provide visibility to the most important fields. For more information on modifying subpanels, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Editing_Subpanels">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<p>Related record subpanels allow the following operations to be performed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To view the details of a related record, click the record's name in the subpanel to open it in record view.</li>
    <li>To relate an existing record to the bug, choose "Link Existing Record" from the subpanel's Action menu, then locate and select the desired record.</li>
    <li>To relate a new record to the bug, click the Plus button to the left of the Actions menu, then complete the record view layout and click "Save".</li>
    <li>To preview the related record, click the Preview icon to the far right of the record's row in the subpanel.</li>
    <li>To inline edit the record directly from the subpanel, choose "Edit" from the Actions menu on the far right of the record's row and click "Save" to preserve the change.</li>
    <li>To delete the bug's relationship to a record, choose "Unlink" from the Actions menu on the far right of the record's row. This removes the relationship, but does not delete the record itself.</li>
    <li>To mark the record as a favorite, click the star icon to the left of the desired record's row.</li>
    <li>To collapse or expand the subpanel, click the Up arrow to the left of the Plus button.</li>
    <li>To change the column size in the subpanel, place your cursor on the column divider and when the Left and Right arrow appears, click and drag the column to the desired size. Please note that the column width will not be preserved when you navigate away from the page.<br /><br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/280ef2d0-e5ab-e973-381a-550308fda751.png" alt="" width="550" height="203" /></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="d232-2535-ee9d-551b224cd50c_Emails_Subpanel">Emails Subpanel</h3>
<p>The Emails subpanel in the Bugs module displays both emails implicitly and explicitly related to the account record. Emails in Sugar are implicitly related to records in Sugar that match an email address in the From, To, or Cc fields in the email. This implicit relationship is made for emails sent from Sugar as well as any email imported into Sugar via Inbound email accounts or email archiving. While composing an email or relating an existing email to a record, users have the ability to set an explicit relationship via the flex relate field by <a href="#e06b545-5f8a-348a-a1db-556e3f1b53ba_Relating_Emails">Relating Emails</a>. This allows the email to be explicitly related to a single record from one of many modules.</p>
<p>The Emails subpanel allows the following functions to be performed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To view the details of an email, click the subject in the subpanel to open it in detail view.</li>
    <li>Minimize the subpanel by clicking "^" (up arrow).</li>
    <li>Expand the subpanel by clicking "v" (down arrow).</li>
    <li>Click "+" to create a new email that will have an implicit relationship with this record.</li>
    <li>Sort the emails by Subject, Status, Date Created, Date Modified, or Assigned User.</li>
    <li>Click "More emails" to see any additional emails hidden by the default view.</li>
    <li>To change the column size in the subpanel, place your cursor on the column divider, and when the Left and Right arrow appears, click and drag the column to the desired size. For more information on resizing columns, please refer to the <a href="#d232-2535-ee9d-551b224cd50c_Column_Resizing">Column Resizing</a> section of this documentation.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Note</strong>: The subpanel column width will not be preserved when you navigate away from the page.</li>

<p>An intelligence pane displays to the right of the bug's record view and provides users with valuable information specific to the bug. The Help Dashboard normally displays by default along with the Record View Help dashlet and Learning Resources dashlet. The Record View Help dashlet provides users with a brief introduction to the module along with some instructions to help users utilize and navigate around the record view. A link to the corresponding documentation (e.g. Bugs documentation) in the Application guide is also provided within the Help dashlet. The Learning Resources dashlet includes links to Sugar University, Community Forums, and Documentation &amp; Support, which provide access to additional resources. Simply click the appropriate link to be directed to the specific page in a separate tab. For more information regarding the Help dashboard, please refer to the <a href="#d03d1-d6ae-25ce-a8e4-551b225ee8d6_Viewing_Via_Record_View">Intelligence Pane</a> documentation. You can access the My Dashboard, which will display some stock dashlets (e.g. Planned Activities dashlet, History dashlet , etc.) by clicking the triangle to the right of "Help Dashboard" and selecting "My Dashboard". Users may choose to view any of their dashboards using the triangle to the right of the current dashboard's name and may create other dashboards for use with the Bugs module by clicking the Create button. Selecting "Edit" from the Actions menu on the upper right will allow them to make changes and add additional dashlets to their dashboards.</p>
<p>Users can edit individual dashlets by clicking the Gear icon on the upper right of each dashlet. Dashlets may also be dragged and dropped to rearrange them within the current dashboard. You can collapse dashlets you do not wish to view by clicking the Up arrow on the upper right of the dashlet. Sugar will remember the state of your intelligence pane the next time you return to the Bugs module. For more information on editing, creating, and rearranging dashboards and dashlets, please refer to the <a href="#d03d1-d6ae-25ce-a8e4-551b225ee8d6_Intelligence_Pane">Intelligence Pane</a> documentation.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/9dea0eb5-1d9b-1d21-0080-550308c0e4db.png" alt="" width="600" height="273" /></p>

<h2 id="d232-2535-ee9d-551b224cd50c_Exporting_Bugs">Exporting Bugs</h2>
<p>Sugar's Export option allows users to download all fields for the selected bugs to their computers as a .CSV (comma-separated values) file. This may be useful when needing to use Bug Report data with other software such as Microsoft Excel or to update existing records by exporting, making changes, then importing the altered bugs back into Sugar. For more information on updating existing records via import, please refer to the <a href="#f-87f1-f338-50da-551b227d034a_Importing_Updates_to_Existing_Records">Import</a> documentation. Due to PHP memory limitations on the server, there may be occasions when the application times out while exporting a large number of bug reports. If you encounter an error when performing this action, we recommend selecting the records in smaller batches.</p>
<p>Bugs may be exported from the Bugs list view by selecting "Export" from the Actions menu.

<h2 id="d232-2535-ee9d-551b224cd50c_Finding_Duplicate_Bugs">Finding Duplicate Bugs</h2>
<p>Between multiple users working in Sugar, importing new records, and converting leads, it is possible for duplicate bug records to be accidentally input to the system. Before creating a new bug record, a good practice is to first check that the bug does not already exist in Sugar. You can locate duplicate records for cleanup using <a href="#d232-2535-ee9d-551b224cd50c_Module_Search">module search</a> from the Bugs list view. Searching for bugs with similar names or other information can turn search into a powerful, duplicates-finding tool. Sugar also provides a wizard for finding potential duplicates that is available from the Bugs record view and may be used as shown below. If duplicate bug records are detected, you can perform a merge per the <a href="#d232-2535-ee9d-551b224cd50c_Merging_Bugs">Merging Bugs</a> section of this documentation.</p>
<p>Please note that your ability to use the Find Duplicates action may be restricted by any role which prevents bug deletion. For more information on roles, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide. Check with your system administrator if you do not see the Find Duplicates option.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to locate duplicate bugs using the Find Duplicates option from the Bugs record view:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to an bug's record view.</li>
    <li>Choose "Find Duplicates" from the Actions menu. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/f315d8b1-5c15-79b7-d189-550308d238f1.png" alt="" width="450" height="190" /></li>
    <li>Potential duplicate bug records will be listed on the Find Duplicates page. Select the duplicate record(s) you wish to merge then click "Merge Duplicates".
        <ul>
            <li>You can preview the duplicate record's details by clicking the Preview button to the far right of the records row.</li>
            <li>You can search for specific records from the Bugs list view if you wish to check for more possible duplicates. For more information on performing a search, please refer to the <a href="#d232-2535-ee9d-551b224cd50c_Module_Search">Module Search</a> section of this documentation.</li>
            <li>You can also click the Column Selection icon above the Preview button to change the list of fields that display on the list view column headers.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

<p>Once you click "Merge Duplicates", the merging process with the current record will begin. For instructions on performing the merge that follows, please refer to Steps 3-9 of the <a href="#d232-2535-ee9d-551b224cd50c_Merging_Via_List_View">Merging Via List View</a> section of this documentation.</p>
<h2 id="d232-2535-ee9d-551b224cd50c_Merging_Bugs">Merging Bugs</h2>
<p>When duplicate records are identified in Sugar, you have the option to merge two or more bugs into a single record. Once the merge is complete, the duplicate bug report(s) will be deleted, and the primary record will remain. Please note that all relationships belonging to the duplicate bugs will be merged to the primary record meaning that any cases, meetings, contacts, etc. related to the duplicate bug report(s) will automatically be related to the resulting, merged bug report.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Date Created, Date Modified, and Password field types are not supported when merging duplicate records in Sugar.</p>

<h3 id="d232-2535-ee9d-551b224cd50c_Merging_Via_List_View">Merging Via List View</h3>
<p><a href="#d232-2535-ee9d-551b224cd50c_Module_Search">Module Search</a> may be used to identify duplicate bugs by, for example, searching for bugs with similar names or categories. Once your search has identified duplicate bug reports, you can merge them directly from the Bugs list view.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to merge bugs via the list view:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Use the <a href="#d232-2535-ee9d-551b224cd50c_Module_Search">Module Search</a> to identify duplicate bug reports.</li>
    <li>Possible duplicates will be displayed in the list view. Select the duplicate record(s) that you wish to merge.
        <ul>
            <li>Please note that up to five records may be merged at once in Sugar. An error message ("Invalid number of records passed. The valid range is from 2 to 5 records.") will appear if more than five records are selected when attempting to perform a merge.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/2d766761-1ba9-4089-84f9-55030878c12b.png" alt="" width="500" height="186" /></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Select "Merge" from the Actions menu to display the Merging Records page. The primary record's field values are displayed on the left while other record's values are in columns to the right. For convenience, fields with differing values will appear on the top of the list.

        <p>If 3 or more records are selected to be merged, an X icon will appear at the top right of each record. Clicking the "X" will remove the record from the merge process but will not delete the record.</p>
    </li>
    <li>To change which record is considered the primary, drag and drop the Primary label on the top of a different column.</li>
    <li>Review the field values in each column and click the radio button to the left of the value that should appear on the final record. You can also manually type or select a new value for any field as necessary.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Note</strong>: Fields you do not have Edit access for cannot be edited on the merging records page.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Preview what the final, merged record will contain as you work by clicking the eye icon to display the preview in the Intelligence Pane.</li>
    <li>Click "Save" once all fields you wish to appear on the single, merged record have their radio buttons selected.</li>
    <li>A pop-up message will display confirming that the duplicate record(s) should be deleted. Click "Confirm" to proceed.</li>

<h2 id="d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Sugar's Reports module allows users to build, generate, and manage reports for modules such as Accounts, Contacts, Calls, etc. Reporting is a valuable tool in Sugar as user's can gather key data from various modules to generate vital information for their organization. There are four types of reports (Rows and Columns Report, Summation Report with Details, Summation Report, Matrix Report) available that can be generated in Sugar. This documentation will cover how to use the Reports module to build, generate, and manage reports, as well as the various actions and options available from within the module.</p>
<h2 id="d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Reports_Module_Tab">Reports Module Tab</h2>
<p>The Reports module tab is typically located on the navigation bar at the top of any Sugar screen. Click the tab to access the Reports list view. You may also hover on the tab to display the Actions, Recently Viewed, and Favorites menu. The Actions menu allows you to perform important actions within the module. The <a href="#d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Viewing_Via_Recently_Viewed">Recently Viewed menu</a> displays the list of reports you last viewed in the module. The <a href="#d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Favoriting_Reports">Favorites menu</a> displays the list of reports you most recently marked as favorites in the module.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/aa2a9855-8922-d5d6-c3e2-55028d5f4591.png" width="454" height="153" alt="aa2a9855-8922-d5d6-c3e2-55028d5f4591.png" /></p>

<h2 id="d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Report_Types">Report Types</h2>
<p>There are four types of reports (Rows and Columns Report, Summation Report, Summation Report with Details, Matrix Report) available for users to create in Sugar. Please note that each report type will provide users with key information for records that meet the specified criteria but will display the report results in different layouts.</p>
<h3 id="d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Rows_and_Columns">Rows and Columns</h3>
<p>The Rows and Columns report is the most basic report to create out of the four report types. The report results will display the data in a simple rows and columns format displaying values for the selected display column fields for all records meeting the specified criteria. Please note that only Rows and Columns-type reports can be exported as a .CSV (comma-separated values) file in Sugar. For more information on creating a Rows and Columns report, please refer to the <a href="#d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Rows_and_Columns_Report">Rows and Columns Report</a> section of this documentation.</p>
<h3 id="d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Summation">Summation</h3>
<p>The Summation Report provides computed data based on the selected fields for records meeting the specified criteria. You can group the report based on one or more fields from the target or related module. The report's result will display the data in groups, summarized using computed derivatives (e.g. SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN) from numeric-type field values (e.g. opportunity amount, amount, etc.) as well as weighted amounts. Summation Reports can be viewed in a chart format and displayed as a Sugar Dashlet on your Home page as well.For more information on creating a Summation Report, please refer to the <a href="#d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Summation_Report">Summation Report</a> section of this documentation.</p>
<h3 id="d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Summation_Report_with_Details">Summation Report with Details</h3>
<p>The Summation Report with Details is a combination of the Summation-type and Rows and Columns-type report as you can group the data, get the total count of records, and choose display columns (e.g. Contacts Name, Account Name, Email Address, etc.) as well. You can group the report based on one or more fields from the target or related module. Summation Report with Details can be viewed in a chart format and displayed as a Sugar Dashlet on your Home page. For more information on creating a Summation Report with Details, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Application_Guide/50_Reports/index.html#Summation_Report_with_Details_2">Summation Report with Details</a> section of this documentation.</p>
<h3 id="d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Matrix">Matrix</h3>
<p>The Matrix Report is also similar to the Summation-type report as it provides an overview of the computed data and displays the total summary count. The report results are displayed in a grid table with row and column headers. The numeric field values for all display summaries will appear on the table along with the grand total amounts for each row and column. Matrix Reports can be viewed in a chart format and displayed as a Sugar Dashlet on your Home page. For more information on creating a Matrix Report, please refer to the <a href="#d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Matrix_Report">Matrix Report</a> section of this documentation.</p>
<h2 id="d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Creating_Reports">Creating Reports</h2>
<p>There are various types of reports (e.g. Rows and Columns Report, Summation Report with Details, Summation Report, Matrix Report) you can create via the Reports module. When you select "Create Report" from the Actions menu of the Reports module tab, the first step of the Report Wizard is to select the report type. Depending on the report type you select will determine the steps you will have to complete to create the report. The following sections will cover creating the four different report types via the Reports module.</p>
<h3 id="d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Rows_and_Columns_Report">Rows and Columns Report</h3>
<p>Out of the four report types, the Rows and Columns report is the most basic one to create in Sugar. Users can simply define filters to determine which records the report will include or exclude then choose the fields (e.g. Name, Email Address, etc.) they would like displayed in the report result. The Rows and Columns report creates a tabular report containing the values of selected display column fields for all records meeting the specified criteria.Please note that only Rows and Columns-type reports have the ability to be exported to a CSV file in Sugar.</p>
<p>The following steps cover creating a Rows and Columns report for calls with a status of held as an example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to the Reports module and select "Create Report". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e7b74f49-4a65-0424-0625-55028dc9ca77.png" width="195" height="119" alt="e7b74f49-4a65-0424-0625-55028dc9ca77.png" /></li>
    <li>Choose "Rows and Columns Report" as the report type and "Calls" as the target module in the following step. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d5db8bb4-7b45-c0df-c8c1-55028a476a8e.png" width="552" height="189" alt="d5db8bb4-7b45-c0df-c8c1-55028a476a8e.png" /></li>
    <li>To filter on a field related to the target module, select it from the Available Fields list on the bottom left, and it will be added to the list of filters. We will select "Status" to filter the report based on call records already held. Click "Next".
        <ul>
            <li>For more information on report filters, please refer to the <a href="#d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Report_Filters">Report Filters</a> section of this documentation.</li>

    <li>On the Choose Display Columns step, select the fields you would like included in the report result from the Available Fields list then click "Next". The following fields will be added to the report: Subject, Status, Description, Date Created, User Name, Contacts Name, and Account Name.
        <ul>
            <li>For more information on selecting display column fields, please refer to the <a href="#d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Report_Display_Columns">Report Display Columns</a> section of this documentation.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Select "Subject", "Date Created", "Status", and "Description" in the Available Fields : Calls list, as these are direct fields of the Calls module. By default the target module fields are displayed in the Available Fields list.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Note</strong>: You can designate the generated report to be sorted by a specific display column field in either ascending or descending order. Simply mark the radio button next to the field label then select "Ascending" or "Descending" in the corresponding dropdown list.</li>

<h3 id="d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Matrix_Report">Matrix Report</h3>
<p>The Matrix Report provides an overview of the data and displays the total for display summaries in a grid format. The numeric field values for all display summaries will appear on the table along with the grand total amounts for each row and column. You can choose a maximum of three group-by columns to group the data in the report.</p>
<p>You can also choose specific layout options (e.g. 1x2 and 2x1) on the Report Details step of the Report Wizard if you selected three group-by columns on the Define Group By step. The 1x2 layout option displays the data for the first group-by field in a row and displays the data for the other two group-by fields in columns. The 2x1 layout option displays the data for the first two group-by fields in rows and displays the data for the third group-by field in a column. If you only have two group-by columns, you can manually change the report layout by dragging and dropping the group-by fields to a different order on the Define Group By step. Please note that the Matrix Report does not provide detailed information like Summation Report with Details and will not include display columns in the report.</p>
<p>The following steps cover creating a Matrix Report for the number of "closed won" opportunities in 2012 by month for each user as an example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to the Reports module and select "Create Report".</li>
    <li>Choose "Matrix Report" as the report type and "Opportunities" as the target module in the following step. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/755bad2c-e3ef-4cf9-2155-55028a82640d.png" width="528" height="184" alt="755bad2c-e3ef-4cf9-2155-55028a82640d.png" /></li>
    <li>To filter on a field related to the target module (Opportunities), select it from the Available Fields list on the bottom left, and it will be added to the list of filters. We will select "Expected Close Date" and "Sales Stage" to filter the report based on closed won opportunities for 2012. Click "Next".
        <ul>
            <li>For more information on report filters, please refer to the <a href="#d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Report_Filters">Report Filters</a> section of this documentation.</li>

    <li>On the Define Group By step, select the field(s) you would like the records in the report result grouped by then click "Next". We will add "User Name" and "Month: Expected Close Date", which will group the opportunity records based on the assigned user and month of expected closed date.
        <ul>
            <li>Please note that you will have to click the related Assigned to User module to select the User Name field as user names are not direct fields of the Opportunities module. Next, click "Opportunities" in the Related Modules list to select "Month: Expected Close Date".</li>
            <li><strong>Note</strong>: The order of the Group By fields determine which fields constitute the X and Y axis of the displayed report grid. For this example, the assigned users will be listed in rows on the Y axis with the month of expected close date displayed across columns on the X axis of the report grid. You can change the order of fields by dragging and dropping the field within the Define Group By section.</li>

<h3 id="d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Report_Filters">Report Filters</h3>
<p>The Define Filters step of the report wizard determines which records the report includes or filters out. Filter groups and operators allow for additional levels of complexity as you combine filters to get the precise result set you desire.</p>
<h4 id="d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Target_Module_Filters">Target Module Filters</h4>
<p>By default, the fields for the Target Module you are creating the report on will be displayed in the Available Fields list. To filter on the field related to the target module, select it from the Available Fields list on the bottom left, and it will be added to the list of filters. Please note that only fields marked as "Reportable" in Studio will display in the Available Fields list. For more information on marking fields as reportable, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Field_Options">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/cb8f88a7-7210-095d-487c-55028a3df439.png" width="178" height="164" alt="cb8f88a7-7210-095d-487c-55028a3df439.png" /></p>
<p>You can also use the search feature above the Available Fields list to easily locate a desired field. Simply enter in the appropriate keyword (e.g. billing, date, etc.) in the search field and the relevant results will display in the Available Fields list. Please note that Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the beginning and end of your search phrase. This allows the system to return all fields that include the keyword entered in the search.</p>
<p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/61546afd-298b-5fbb-d935-55028dc7982f.png" width="176" height="184" alt="61546afd-298b-5fbb-d935-55028dc7982f.png" /></p>
<h4 id="d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Related_Module_Filters">Related Module Filters</h4>
<p>The Related Modules list shows all modules that have a relationship with the target module. To filter on a field in a related module, choose the name of the module (e.g. Documents) in the Related Modules list, and the Available Fields list below will display fields belonging to the related module. You can select the desired field(s) from the related module to add as a filter for your report. Please note that only fields marked as "Reportable" in Studio will display in the Available Fields list. For more information on marking fields as reportable, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/01_Studio#Field_Options">Studio</a> documentation in the Administration guide. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b6c71bd2-eaa6-b51e-a186-55028aa2024b.png" width="382" height="349" alt="b6c71bd2-eaa6-b51e-a186-55028aa2024b.png" /></p>
<p>You can also use the search feature above the Available Fields list to easily locate a desired field. Simply enter in the appropriate keyword (e.g. billing, date, etc.) in the search field and the relevant results will display in the Available Fields list. P lease note that Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the beginning and end of your search phrase. This allows the system to return all fields that include the keyword entered in the search. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/28600492-7d2a-2ae8-0ee4-55028dfab477.png" width="174" height="169" alt="28600492-7d2a-2ae8-0ee4-55028dfab477.png" /></p>
<h4 id="d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Filter_Values">Filter Values</h4>
<p>Once the filter has been created, you can specify what field values constitute a match for the report in the Define Filters section. Select the appropriate value from the corresponding dropdown list and enter the relevant value in the open text box (if applicable).</p>
<p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/9f92fc5b-6d49-bff4-ecb2-55028a6f6964.png" width="568" height="104" alt="9f92fc5b-6d49-bff4-ecb2-55028a6f6964.png" /></p>
<p>Please note that if the assigned user or a member of your team changes or adds a new filter, the system alerts you that the report filters have been modified since last run when you save and run the report. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/46829e1e-8e9b-8a7f-f52f-55028dfb3ba7.png" width="266" height="189" alt="46829e1e-8e9b-8a7f-f52f-55028dfb3ba7.png" /></p>
<h4 id="d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Run-Time_Filters">Run-Time Filters</h4>
<p>The run-time option in the Define Filters step allows you to make the filter(s) available on the saved report, which enables you to quickly change your filter values without having to edit the report. Simply mark the Run-time box for any filter(s) you wish to view on the saved report. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/780b729b-fe2d-b139-9129-55028aae9fc9.png" width="553" height="99" alt="780b729b-fe2d-b139-9129-55028aae9fc9.png" /></p>
<p>Once the report is created and saved, the run-time filter (e.g. "Accounts &gt; Date Created") will appear on the generated report view. You can change the filter values directly from the report view by selecting the new filter values from the dropdown list and clicking "Apply" or "Run Report" at the top of the report's detail view. Clicking the Reset button will reset the run-time filter back to the original filter value you set. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/264ebac9-52c0-13a4-5709-55028a77f6a9.png" width="480" height="94" alt="264ebac9-52c0-13a4-5709-55028a77f6a9.png" /></p>
<p>Please note that the Report Wizard retains the original filter value(s) you set when building the report regardless of the changes you or other user's make on the run-time filters on the report's detail view. If the report is shared by a team, then each user can run the report with different run-time filter values to meet their individual needs. The run-time filter values set by each user will be preserved for future viewing until they change or reset the value.</p>
<h4 id="d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Operators">Operators</h4>
<p>When building the report, you have the option to choose between two operators, "AND" and "OR", using dropdowns within the Define Filters section. By default, operators are set to "AND" which will cause the filters to work cumulatively. All filters, or groups of filters under an AND operator will need to be true for a record in order for that record to appear in the report result. Changing an operator to "OR" will mean that if any single filter under that "OR" is true for a record, the record will be included on the report. The OR operator accepts records matching any of the filters while the AND operator accepts records matching all filters.</p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/96de6094-0343-9f80-1210-55028a060742.png" width="338" height="84" alt="96de6094-0343-9f80-1210-55028a060742.png" />
<h4 id="d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Filter_Groups">Filter Groups</h4>
<p>By default, all filters will be added to a single group. To split filters into multiple groups, use the Add Filter Group button.</p>
<p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d28b0724-83fa-4efd-bcdc-55028a35be58.png" width="169" height="94" alt="d28b0724-83fa-4efd-bcdc-55028a35be58.png" /></p>
<p>When you have more than one filter group and click a new filter field, Sugar will prompt for which filter group the new field should belong.</p>
<p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/4b5a4375-a447-bd7f-2639-55028a74ae03.png" width="173" height="179" alt="4b5a4375-a447-bd7f-2639-55028a74ae03.png" /></p>
<p>Filter groups and operators can be combined to achieve complex filtering situations. For example, if we need a report for documents belonging to accounts created prior to the first quarter where the document is either new this week or new this month if connected to a lead, we wou ld use the following filter groups with an OR operator joining the two together: <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/50fc0a16-2c81-2712-869e-55028d923872.png" width="600" height="289" alt="50fc0a16-2c81-2712-869e-55028d923872.png" /></p>
<h4 id="d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Filters_on_Date_and_Datetime_Fields">Filters on Date and Datetime Fields</h4>
<p>When creating reports in Sugar, specifying a range of time is a useful way to isolate your desired results. Sugar provides a set of pre-defined options to help you easily target the most common date ranges:</p>

<p>For more information about configuring the Forecasting module, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/10_Forecast">Forecast Configuration</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>When generating reports with datetime filters, Sugar will always adjust the results to ensure they are accurate according to the time zone settings of the user accessing the report. For instance, a user on Eastern Standard Time (-5 GMT) may see a different set of results for a report than a user on Pacific Standard Time (-8 GMT) because the date ranges are adjusted for the user's time zone.</p>
<h3 id="d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Report_Display_Columns">Report Display Columns</h3>
<p>The display columns step allows users to select which field(s) they would like included when generating the report. The system will pull data specific to these fields based on the report criteria for the associated module record. When you select a field from the Available Fields list, they will be added to the right of the list with the displayed path of the field (e.g. Contacts &gt; Assigned to User &gt; User Name). The displayed field paths show users where the field is originating from to retrieve the value for the report. For example, although "Email Address" appears as a field in several modules (e.g. Accounts, Contacts, Leads, etc.), email addresses are actually stored in their own table and are related to the modules where they appear as opposed to being direct fields of those modules. So, the corresponding displayed path will show the primary module record, then the related module followed by the field name (e.g. Contacts &gt; Email Address &gt; Email Address) since the email address field is a field of the related Email Address module.</p>
<p>To remove any unecessary fields from the display column list, simply click the "-" sign to the far right of the displayed field path row.</p>
<h4 id="d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Changing_Display_Column_Labels">Changing Display Column Labels</h4>
<p>By default, the selected display column fields will display stock labels which can be changed if you desire. To change the label, simply enter in the new label name in the open text field then click outside of the text box to preserve the change. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d6c8444f-fd76-ae0d-14ff-55028db6fb1d.png" width="511" height="89" alt="d6c8444f-fd76-ae0d-14ff-55028db6fb1d.png" /></p>
<h4 id="d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Changing_Display_Column_Order">Changing Display Column Order</h4>
<p>You can change the left-to-right order of the display columns by dragging and dropping the displayed field paths in the Choose Display Columns section.</p>
<p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/95004b1d-a1cd-e301-103d-55028d6ae326.png" width="489" height="124" alt="95004b1d-a1cd-e301-103d-55028d6ae326.png" /></p>
<h4 id="d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Defining_Column_Sort">Defining Column Sort</h4>
<p>You can also designate the generated report to be sorted by a specific field column in either ascending or descending order. Simply mark the radio button next to the field label then select "Ascending" or "Descending" in the corresponding dropdown list. Please note that only one display column can be designated to sort by default in the report.</p>
<p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/4aa05a64-e3c0-c888-0498-55028d452bbe.png" width="606" height="149" alt="4aa05a64-e3c0-c888-0498-55028d452bbe.png" /></p>
<h3 id="d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Optional_Related_Modules">Optional Related Modules</h3>
<p>The Optional Related Modules option will appear on the Report Details step if you add fields from related modules to the display column. Please note that if you want your report to include records whether or not they have data in the fields, you will need to mark the displayed module relationship(s) in the Optional Related Modules section. For example, if you add the email address field as a display column for the New Leads report, the Optional Related Modules section will display "Leads &gt; Email Address". Check the box for the Email Address relationship in order to include all applicable results even if the lead record does not contain an email address. By default, Sugar treats all related modules in a report as mandatory meaning that an email address will be required for a lead record to be included.</p>
<p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/3c2facc7-4178-a863-e4f0-55028a38a42e.png" width="529" height="237" alt="3c2facc7-4178-a863-e4f0-55028a38a42e.png" /></p>
<p>Leaving this box unchecked will exclude all lead records from your report that do not have an email address associated with them.</p>
<p>This holds true for all related modules. You will need to check the box for any relationship you do not wish to be treated as mandatory when Sugar is generating your report.</p>
<h3 id="d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Show_Query">Show Query</h3> The Show Query option is only visible to system administrators and displays as a checkbox on the Report Details step. If the Show Query box is checked and the Preview button is clicked, the generated report will display all the SQL queries at the bottom of the page for administrators to use and analyze how the specific data was retrieved in the system. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/67270c0a-809e-3513-bcb9-55028d369549.png" width="503" height="133" alt="67270c0a-809e-3513-bcb9-55028d369549.png" />

<h2 id="d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Searching_Reports">Searching Reports</h2>
<p>The Reports list view includes a Basic and Advanced Search to help you locate reports easily and effectively in a module-specific manner. Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Reports list view below. Please note that Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all reports that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %accounts). This will pull up any report that has the word "accounts" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p>
<p>For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Search">Search</a> documentation.</p>

<h4 id="d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Summation_Report_Result">Summation Report Result</h4>
<p>The Summation Report provides an overview of the selected field data(s) grouped by specific criteria(s). The report result displays the data in groups summarized using computed derivatives (e.g. SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN) from numeric-type field values (e.g. opportunity amount, amount, etc.) as well as weighted amounts. Each field you select in the Define Group By and Choose Display Summaries will be displayed as a column in the report result. The field(s) in the Define Group By list determines how the data will be grouped on the report results table and the chart. For example, if you group the opportunity report by "User Name" then "Month: Expected Close Date" on the Define Group By list, the opportunity records will be grouped by the user assigned to the opportunity and each user will be broken up by month of the expected close date on the report result. The grand total of the summarized field values will display at the bottom of the report results page.</p>
<p>You can sort the report results by a field column in either ascending or descending order. To sort by a field or switch the sort direction, click the column header noting that the fields which allow sorting will have a pair of arrows.

<h4 id="d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Matrix_Report_Result">Matrix Report Result</h4>
<p>The Matrix report groups the fields based on the group by fields and displays the summary for specific numeric-type field values that you select. The report result displays the data in a grid table with row and column headers. If you selected three group-by columns, then you will have the option to choose specific report layout's (e.g. 1x2 and 2x1) on the Report Details step. The 1x2 layout option will display the data for the first group-by field in a row and display the data for the other two group-by fields in columns.

<p>Sugar allows you to select up to 1000 records at a time for deletion. If you desire to delete more than 1000 records, you will need to perform the deletions in several batches.</p>
<h2 id="d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Exporting_Reports">Exporting Reports</h2>
<p>Sugar's Export option allows users to download the data in reports as a .CSV (comma-separated values) file. Please note that only Rows and Columns-type reports have the ability to be exported. For more information on exporting records in Sugar, please refer to the <a href="#e6004c-15af-3450-3b7e-551b22bbe5d2_Exporting_From_Reports">Export</a> documentation. This may be useful when needing to use the report data with other software such as Microsoft Excel or to update existing records by creating a report (including Record ID's), exporting, making changes, then importing the altered data back into Sugar. For more information on updating existing records via import, please refer to the <a href="#f-87f1-f338-50da-551b227d034a_Importing_Updates_to_Existing_Records">Import</a> documentation.Due to PHP memory limitations on the server, there may be occasions when the application times out while exporting a report with a large amount of data. If you encounter an error when performing this action, we recommend breaking up the report in smaller batches.</p>

<h2 id="d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Duplicating_Reports">Duplicating Reports</h2>
<p>You can create a new report by duplicating an existing report in Sugar. The duplicate option is useful if the report you are creating has similar information to an existing report, so there is less new data for you to enter. You have the option of duplicating the report as the original report type that you are currently viewing or any of the other three report types.</p>
<p>The following steps cover creating a report by duplicating an existing Rows and Columns-type report as an example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to a report's detail view.</li>
    <li>Click the Actions menu and select "Duplicate".</li>
    <li>Choose the report type you would like the duplicated report to be. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/2f20dea4-fbcd-67cf-4757-55028d707a1c.png" width="224" height="199" alt="2f20dea4-fbcd-67cf-4757-55028d707a1c.png" /></li>
    <li>Go through the Report Wizard to select and enter new data as necessary then enter a new name for the report and save.
        <ul>
            <li>Please note that if you select a report type other than the original type, there may be additional or less steps in the Report Wizard to complete and you may need to edit the report as necessary to meet the specific report type requirements.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Scheduling_Reports">Scheduling Reports</h2>
<p>Reports in Sugar can be scheduled to be emailed to users periodically based on specified date and time intervals. Please note that each individual user has to schedule the report in their Sugar account in order for the reports to be delivered to them. Sugar will run the report at the specified interval based on the set time zone in user preferences and sends it as a PDF file to your email address on file. Please note that the outbound mail server for the system as well as the user's email settings must be configured properly in order for the reports to be delivered successfully. For more information on setting up the system email settings, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/06_Email#Email_Settings">Email</a> documentation in the Administration guide. For more information on setting up your user preferences' email settings, please refer to the <a href="#e-543f-551b22c2c01c___Email_Settings">Getting Started</a> documentation.</p>
<p>The Run Report Generation Scheduled Tasks scheduler in Sugar processes all scheduled reports to be delivered to the user at the scheduled interval. By default, the report scheduler is set as "Inactive" for new Sugar installations. Administrators must check to make sure that the Run Report Generation Scheduled Tasks scheduler is active and the settings (e.g. interval) are configured properly. F or example, if the scheduler is set to trigger once per day and a user schedules a report to be delivered every hour, the report will only be delivered once each day due to the set interval in the scheduler. The administrator must change the interval for the scheduler to run every 1 hour in order for the users report to be processed and delivered per their scheduled interval.For more information on configuring schedulers, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/05_System/41_Schedulers#Editing_Schedulers">Schedulers</a> section of the System documentation.</p>

<h2 id="d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Adding_Report_Results_to_Target_Lists">Adding Report Results to Target Lists</h2>
<p>A target list consists of a group of individuals or organizations you wish to be included or excluded on a mass marketing campaign. These targets are typically identified based on a set of predetermined criteria such as being a prospect or existing customer, age group, industry, etc. The Reports module gives users the ability to add a large number of records (e.g. Contacts, Leads, Accounts, etc.) to a target list at once instead of selecting them one-by-one. For example, if you need to add all leads in the state of California to your target list, you can create a report based on the Leads module filtered by the Primary Address State field (e.g. CA). Once the report is created and saved, you can navigate to the Target Lists module to add the report results to the specific target list. Go down to the Leads subpanel in the Target List's detail view, click the Actions menu, then choose "Select from Reports". Select the saved lead report from the pop-up window and all lead records from the selected report will be added to the target list.</p>

Sugar allows up to 1000 records to be added at a time when adding to a target list. If you desire to add more than 1000 records to a target list, you will need to create the reports in several batches.</p>
<h1 id="d09b-79b4-5106-551b22eb1468_Advanced_Reports">Advanced Reports</h1>
<h2 id="d09b-79b4-5106-551b22eb1468_Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Advanced reports allow users to create custom reports using a single or a combination of SQL statements to directly query your Sugar database. Although the Reports module may be used to create many kinds of reports, users with SQL knowledge may use advanced reports to craft direct database queries for more flexible and extensible reporting. </p>
<p>Advanced reports are a combination of three related modules:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Custom Queries</strong> : Custom query records contain the SQL statement used to pull information from the database.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Formats</strong> : Data format records describe how to format and display the results of the related custom query. Data formats may also be interrelated to create child/parent combinations of queries.</li>
    <li><strong>Advanced Reports</strong> : Advanced report records serve as headers for the report and may display one or more data format. The advanced report record may also be scheduled to be automatically run and emailed to a user.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You must be an administrator in order to create, edit, and delete custom queries. Data formats and advanced reports may be created and manipulated by non-admin users according to their team access. Admin users wishing to build advanced reports must first be familiar with SQL and Sugar's database structure in order to write the necessary custom queries.</p>
<h2 id="d09b-79b4-5106-551b22eb1468_Advanced_Reports_Module_Tab">Advanced Reports Module Tab</h2>
<p>Advanced Reports may be accessed by navigating to the Reports module which is typically located on the navigation bar at the top of any Sugar screen. Click the tab to access triangle to the right of the Reports tab, then click "Manage Advanced Reports" from the actions menu. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/f23c0971-9873-6d3c-4db8-550307dd864d.png" alt="" width="203" height="171" /></p>
<p>From within the Advanced Reports module, clicking the Advanced Reports tab in the navigation bar will display the list view. Click the triangle to the right of "Advanced Reports" to access the Actions menu. Below the Actions menu is the Recently Viewed menu displays the three advanced reports you have most recently opened. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/84eb4995-2ec2-6ccb-05cf-550307c080dd.png" alt="" width="213" height="374" /></p>

<p>Since a single advanced report consists of records from three different modules, the following instructions will step through creating a record within each module and relating those records to generate a report. First, a custom query record will be created, then a data format, and finally an advanced report record. The fields specific to each module are described prior to each set of creation instructions.</p>
<h3 id="d09b-79b4-5106-551b22eb1468_Custom_Query_Fields">Custom Query Fields</h3>
<p>The Custom Query module contains a number of stock fields which come out-of-the-box with Sugar. The below definitions are suggested meanings for the fields, but the fields can be leveraged differently to best meet your organization's needs.</p>

<h3 id="d09b-79b4-5106-551b22eb1468_Creating_Custom_Query_Records">Creating Custom Query Records</h3>
<p>Advanced reports enable you to create reports using complex SQL queries that cannot be expressed in standard reports. The SQL query is contained in a custom query record. Each custom query record can be related to multiple data format records which allows it to be reused in multiple reports.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click the triangle in the Advanced Reports module tab to open the actions menu and select "Create Custom Query".<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/7d71399f-fbf8-edef-098e-550307e8b8f3.png" alt="" width="213" height="267" /></li>

</ol>
<p>After you click "Save", Sugar will determine whether the SQL statement provided in the Custom Query field is valid. If it is not, Sugar will display an error message and provide an opportunity for you to correct the SQL. The custom query record may not be saved unless the SQL statement is deemed valid by Sugar.</p>

<div>
    <p>A data format specifies report formatting details such as the text font, text color, and the background color for a particular SQL query contained in a custom query record. You can reference other data formats within a data format. The query contained in the referenced data format is considered to be the sub-query or the child-query. When a data format references another data format, the data formats are interlocked. Interlocked reports are useful to produce information from separate queries in a parent-child pattern. For more information, please refer to the Interlocked Reports section of this documentat</p>

<h3 id="d09b-79b4-5106-551b22eb1468_Relating_the_Advanced_Report_and_Data_Format_Records">Relating the Advanced Report and Data Format Records</h3>
<p>After creating all three types of records as described above, use the following steps to relate the advanced report record to one or more data format records:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click the Advanced Reports module tab to access the Advanced Reports list view.</li>
    <li>Search for the advanced report record created in the steps above and click the record's name to open it in detail view.</li>
    <li>Below the advanced report information, click the Select button.</li>
    <li>Find the data format record created in the steps above and click the record's name to link it to the advanced report.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="d09b-79b4-5106-551b22eb1468_Running_Advanced_Reports">Running Advanced Reports</h2>
<p>Finally, click on "Run Report" and it will return a custom report populated with results from your custom query and displayed with your designated data format.</p>
<h2 id="d09b-79b4-5106-551b22eb1468_Aggregating_Queries_on_a_Single_Report">Aggregating Queries on a Single Report</h2>
<p> A single advanced report record may relate to one or more data format records, each of which includes its own query. The bottom of an advanced report detail view displays a list of data formats included in the report. When multiple data formats are included on a single report, their individual tables will be stacked. Two <a href="#d09b-79b4-5106-551b22eb1468_Data_Format_Fields">data format fields</a>, "Combine with previous Data Format" and "Group with Previous Header" will affect how multiple data formats are displayed on a single report.</p>
<p>The following actions are available on an advanced report detail view for manipulating its related data formats:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Create New</strong> : Create a new data format record which will be automatically related to this advanced report</li>
    <li><strong>Select</strong> : Select an existing data format record to relate to this advanced report; only data formats which are not already related to a report and do not have a parent data format will be available for selection.</li>
    <li><strong>Up</strong> : Move a data format's table to a higher position in a report containing several data formats.</li>
    <li><strong>Down</strong> : Move a data format's table to a lower position in a report containing several data formats.</li>
    <li><strong>Edit</strong> : Open the data format in edit view in order to make changes</li>
    <li><strong>Delete</strong> : Remove the data format from this report; the data format record will not be deleted</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: data format record can only belong to one advanced report. If you wish to use one custom query with several reports, you must create a separate data format record for each report - each of which may relate to the single custom query record. Also, data formats which have a parent data format (as displayed in the Parent Format field) are considered child data formats and may not be directly added to a report. Parent data formats which have child data formats are eligible to be included on a report.</p>
<h3 id="d09b-79b4-5106-551b22eb1468_Adding_Multiple_Data_Formats_to_a_Report">Adding Multiple Data Formats to a Report</h3>
<p>For our example, we will add two different data formats to a single report. First we want to show a list of each of the sales representatives along with a count of how many calls and meetings they made in the last week. This is the first query and the first data format which we have named "Activity Counts".</p>
<p>Beneath this </p>
<h2 id="d09b-79b4-5106-551b22eb1468_Interlocking_ParentChildQueries">Interlocking Parent/Child Queries</h2>
<p>Sugar allows you to interlock two queries in a parent/child relationship by relating two data format records. This allows for more complex report results that are displayed in a parent/child format mirroring the queries' relationship. Sugar will first run the parent query, then, for each row of the parent query, it will run the child query.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to interlock a pair of simple queries as an example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Create a custom query record called "All Users Query" with the following SQL statement:<br />Select id, user_name from users</li>
    <li>Create a second custom query record called "Accounts By Users Query" with the following SQL statement:<br />Select name, assigned_user_id from accounts where assigned_user_id = '{sub}id{sub}'</li>
    <li>Create a data format record called "All Users Format" with the Query Name field set to "All Users Query".</li>
    <li>Create a data format record called "Accounts By Users Format" with the Query Name field set to "Accounts By Users Query" and the Parent Data Format field set to "All Users Format".</li>
    <li>Create an advanced report record.</li>
    <li>From the advanced report's detail view, use the Select button to choose "All Users Format".</li>
    <li>Click the Run Report button.</li>
</ol>
<p>The '{sub}id{sub}' is inserted to the child query to refer to the parent query's current result row. In this example, Sugar will generate a list of user names and id's. Below each user row, a list of accounts assigned to that particular user will appear. The child query is returning assigned_user_id to help make the functionality clear.</p>
<p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8b3b02b1-bda5-a6c4-412a-5503077ff5ab.png" alt="" width="451" height="150" /></p>
<p>Please note that a child data format cannot be run from it's own record nor added to an advanced report record. Only by running its parent data format or adding its parent data format to a report will the child query's results be displayed.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Only two data formats may be interlocked at a time. Chains of three or more data format records will cause Sugar not to recognize the queries three or more levels deep.</p>
<h2 id="d09b-79b4-5106-551b22eb1468_Column-Level_Formatting">Column-Level Formatting</h2>
<p>Each data format includes formatting options such as color, size, etc which affect the entirety of the custom query's table and header. These options are available while editing the data format record and include these fields. In addition, each column of a query's table may be formatted individually using the options available on the detail view of a data format record. Please note, in order for these options to be available, the related custom query must be returning at least one row.</p>
<h3 id="d09b-79b4-5106-551b22eb1468_Formatting_a_Columns_Header">Formatting a Column's Header</h3>
<p>Once you have created a data format record including choosing a custom query record which will return at least one row of data, a table will be displayed at the bottom of the data format record's detail view. The following options are available for formatting a particular column's header:</p>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Field</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Display Name</td>
            <td>Replaces the text of the column's header which defaults to the column name specified in the custom query's SQL statement</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Display Type</td>
            <td>The display type of this column's header text</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Font Size</td>
            <td>The size of this column's header text</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Font Style</td>
            <td>Specifies if the column's header text should be bolded or italicized</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Format Type</td>
            <td>The displayed format (Month, Quarter, Year, etc.) of this column's header text </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Header Background Color</td>
            <td>The background color of this column's header</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Header Text Color</td>
            <td>The text color of this column's header</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Wrap Text</td>
            <td>Specifies if long text in this column's header should wrap to multiple lines</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>The following steps will walk through modifying the header to display a desired column name rather than the field name shown by default:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to the detail view of a data format record who's custom query is returning at least one row of data.</li>
    <li>Click the pencil icon above the table column you wish to format.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/62f19e1d-6d86-8dc6-c846-55030724f3ad.png" alt="" width="357" height="155" /></li>
    <li>Check the "Modify Header Attributes" checkbox in the pop-up window.</li>
    <li>Type "Sally Bronsen's Activities" in the Display Name field and make any other desired modifications.</li>
    <li>Click "Save" then "Close".<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/2108e294-9be7-0797-632e-550307a76719.png" alt="" width="474" height="357" /></li>
</ol>
<p>After closing the pop-up window, the table will refresh to show the changes you made to the column. For our example, the column name "activity_type" has been replaced with the text "Sally Bronsen's Activities".<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a0c29a9e-c9f6-8e4d-ba27-550307656c2c.png" alt="" width="420" height="140" /></p>

<p>Once you have created a data format record including choosing a custom query record which will return at least one row of data, a table will be displayed at the bottom of the data format record's detail view. The following options are available for formatting a particular column's data cells:</p>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Field</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Description</strong></td>

            <td>Body Background Color</td>
            <td>The background color of this column's data cells</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Body Text Color</td>
            <td>The text color of this column's data cells</td>

            <td>Specifies if this column's data cell text should be formatted as plain text, currency, date, or datetime values </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Table Width</td>
            <td>The width of this column's data cells and header as a percentage of the table width or as an absolute number of pixels</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Wrap Text</td>
            <td>Specifies if long text in this column's data cells should wrap to multiple lines</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>The following steps will walk through modifying a column to display a column of datetime data as a simple date value as an example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to the detail view of a data format record who's custom query is returning at least one row of data.</li>
    <li>Click the pencil icon above the table column you wish to format.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8298b3c9-fae4-17d5-1e4c-550307a0ebd8.png" alt="" width="377" height="146" /></li>
    <li>Check the "Modify Body Attributes" checkbox in the pop-up window.</li>
    <li>Choose "Date" for the Format Type field and make any other desired modifications.</li>
    <li>Click "Save" then "Close".<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/77ed5016-edc5-6ac1-c186-550307eeac66.png" alt="" width="493" height="330" /></li>
</ol>
<p>After closing the pop-up window, the table will refresh to show the changes you made to the column. For our example, the column of database datetime values will now be displayed as simple date values.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/44c883f7-a978-e128-ac48-550307a9583d.png" alt="" width="340" height="139" /></p>
<h3 id="d09b-79b4-5106-551b22eb1468_Hiding_Columns">Hiding Columns</h3>
<p>If an individual column should not be displayed in a report's output, the column may be marked as hidden on the data format record. This will prevent it from being displayed when running an advanced report which includes the data format.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to hide a column from a report's output:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to the detail view of a data format record who's custom query is returning at least one row of data.</li>
    <li>Click the pencil icon above the table column you wish to format.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8298b3c9-fae4-17d5-1e4c-550307a0ebd8.png" alt="" width="377" height="146" /></li>

<h3 id="d09b-79b4-5106-551b22eb1468_Reordering_Columns">Reordering Columns</h3>
<p> The default column order of a table is determined by the SQL statement used in the custom query record. The column order can be changed at the data format record level when a different order is desired on the data format or in the final advanced report record.</p>
<p>Use the following steps to change the column order for a data format record:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to the detail view of a data format record who's custom query is returning at least one row of data.</li>
    <li>At the top of a column, click the right arrow to move the column one position right. Click the left arrow to move it one position left.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8a190874-5488-5d47-6e97-5503079140a3.png" alt="" width="411" height="212" /></li>

<h2 id="d09b-79b4-5106-551b22eb1468_Scheduling_Advanced_Reports">Scheduling Advanced Reports</h2>
<p>Advanced reports can be scheduled to be emailed to users periodically based on specified date and time intervals. Please note that each individual user has to schedule the report in their Sugar account in order for the reports to be delivered to them. Sugar will run the advanced report at the specified interval based on the set time zone in user preferences and send it as a <span>PDF</span> file to your email address on file. </p>
<p>The outbound mail server for the system as well as the user's email settings must be configured properly in order for the reports to be delivered successfully. For more information on setting up the system email settings, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/06_Email/#Email_Settings">Email</a> documentation in the Administration guide. For more information on setting up your user preferences' email settings, please refer to the <a href="#e-543f-551b22c2c01c___Email_Settings">Getting Started</a> documentation.</p>
<p>The Run Report Generation Scheduled Tasks scheduler in Sugar processes all scheduled advanced reports to be delivered to the user at the scheduled interval. By default, this report scheduler is set as "Inactive" for new Sugar installations. Administrators must check to make sure that the Run Report Generation Scheduled Tasks scheduler is active and the settings (e.g. interval) are configured properly. F or example, if the scheduler is set to trigger once per day and a user schedules a report to be delivered every hour, the report will only be delivered once each day due to the set interval in the scheduler. The administrator must change the interval for the scheduler to run every 1 hour in order for the user's report to be processed and delivered per their scheduled interval. For more information on configuring schedulers, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/05_System/41_Schedulers/#Editing_Schedulers">Schedulers</a> section of the System documentation.</p>

<p>Once the report is scheduled successfully, the date and time for the scheduled report will appear in the list view row for the specific advanced report.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/84ba7f7b-2b90-1dc3-e2ad-550307de3852.png" alt="" width="451" height="67" /></p>
<h2 id="d09b-79b4-5106-551b22eb1468_ExportingData_Formats">Exporting Data Formats</h2>
<p>Sugar's Export option allows users to download the data in individual data format tables as a .csv (comma-separated values) file. This may be useful when needing to use the report data with other software such as Microsoft Excel. In order for the tables belonging to an advanced report or data format record to be available for export, the data format record's "Exportable (CSV File Only)" field must be checked.Due to PHP memory limitations on the server, there may be occasions when the application times out while exporting a table with a large amount of data. If you encounter an error when performing this action, we recommend breaking up the queries in smaller batches. For more information on exporting records in Sugar, please refer to the <a href="#d09b-79b4-5106-551b22eb1468_Exporting_Via_Advanced_Reports">Export</a> documentation.Please note that your ability to export reports from Sugar may be restricted by a role.

    <p>There may be times in which users will want to access, review, or manipulate information from their Sugar database in another format outside of Sugar. To facilitate this process, users have two options on ways to export their data from Sugar. Upon exporting data from Sugar, a CSV ("Comma Separated Value") format file will be downloaded to the users computer. This file can be reviewed in Microsoft Excel, Notepad, or other spreadsheet tools and text editors.</p>
    <p>Exporting restrictions can be controlled by a System Administrator via Admin &gt; Locale. For more information on the Locale menu, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/05_System#Export_Settings">Locale</a> section of the Administration guide. An administrator also has the option to create a Role hindering regular users' access to the export functionality.

    <h2 id="e6004c-15af-3450-3b7e-551b22bbe5d2_Exporting_From_Module_List_Views">Exporting From Module List Views</h2>
    <p>The first type of export that will be covered is exporting from the module list view. When exporting this way, the downloaded file contains every field from the database within the given module for the specified record or records. This export will not include any information from records which are associated via relationships to this module. Please note that the export method varies slightly between modules using the Sidecar user interface (e.g. Accounts, Contacts, Leads, etc.) and Legacy user interface (e.g. Calls, Meetings, Quotes, etc.).</p>
    <p>This export method is most useful when performing a type of data migration, needing an excess of detail, or performing a comprehensive import and update of the data, since this method exports all fields within a module. It is recommended the <a href="#e6004c-15af-3450-3b7e-551b22bbe5d2_Exporting_From_Reports">Export From Reports</a> functionality be used for any other export use case to isolate the specific information needed.</p>
    <p>Due to PHP memory limitations on the server, there may be occasions when the application times out while exporting a large number of records. If you encounter an error when performing this action, we recommend selecting the records in smaller batches.</p>

    <p>When data is exported from Sugar, the file that is produced is a CSV, or "Comma Separated Value" file. When viewed in a plain text editor, a CSV file looks like a long string of text with groupings of text separated with quotation marks and commas (e.g. "First Name","Last Name","Title"). The file first lists out all columns that are in the file, and then the corresponding rows follow, also separated by quotation marks and commas (e.g. "Dusty","Connor","IT Developer").</p>
    <p>However, most spreadsheet software, such as Microsoft Excel, will read this file and convert the quotation marks and commas into rows and columns. This makes your data much easier to read and turns it into a useful format that can be manipulated and re-purposed as need be.</p>
    <p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/9fba33f5-808f-229b-f9c9-550305a8b616.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/9fba33f5-808f-229b-f9c9-550305a8b616.png" height="45" width="223" /></p>
    <p>The records that appear in your spreadsheet are dependent on what type of search, if any, you did prior to your export.</p>
    <p>When exporting from list view, the user is left with every part of the module database information, which is often not all readable by the user. This file will only contain information specific to the module where the export was performed. This exported data will comprise of all stock and custom fields from the module. No data that would normally be found in a subpanel will appear on this export.</p>
    <h2 id="e6004c-15af-3450-3b7e-551b22bbe5d2_Exporting_From_Reports">Exporting From Reports</h2>
    <p>In addition to exporting from a list view, users also have the option to export data from a report. Using a Rows and Columns report, users can select the specific fields they would like to see on the export file and filter the module data however they would like. The advantage to using reports is that users will only be presented with the data that they need, and no excess data. In addition, users can also export data from related modules using reports, which is not possible when <a href="#e6004c-15af-3450-3b7e-551b22bbe5d2_Exporting_From_Module_List_Views">Exporting From Module List Views</a>. Finally, because the reports are much more focused and specific, there is a higher threshold of the quantity of records that can be exported before encountering a timeout or any other such issues.</p>
    <p>Due to PHP memory limitations on the server, there may be occasions when the application times out while exporting a report with a large amount of data. If you encounter an error when performing this action, we recommend breaking up the report in smaller batches.</p>
    <p>For more information on creating your report, please refer to the <a href="#d-319b-7af9-122b-551b22571e75_Rows_and_Columns_Report">Reports</a> documentation.</p>
    <p>Use the following steps to complete an export from a report:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select an existing Rows and Columns report from the Report module's listview, or create a new one based on the information that you would like to export.</li>
        <li>Click on the actions menu of the report details and select "Export". <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/63dad46e-d740-615c-cffe-550306112ecf.png" alt="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/63dad46e-d740-615c-cffe-550306112ecf.png" width="254" height="192" /></li>
        <li>The CSV file will be downloaded to your computer to a location defined by your browser settings. The file can then be read and manipulated at will.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>When exporting from a report, the data is more well-rounded for a user to review. The user is allowed to determine what fields should be included on the export. This means that while reviewing it in a spreadsheet, the information appears exactly as it does in Sugar. This makes for a more positive user experience and a more focused export file. In addition, the user is able to utilize related modules to the reported on module. This makes the report more useful in a business sense for individual users.</p>

    <p>For most modules, Sugar allows users to transfer data from an external source (usually a comma-separated-values file) into the database via import. Sugar's import wizard is a quick and easy way to create and/or update many records at once. The import tool can be used to add a list of new customers or leads to the database, update existing data, migrate from a previous CRM system, or for any process that requires manipulating a large amount of records at once.</p>
    <p>Your system's Sugar administrator may enable importing for the following modules:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Accounts</li>
        <li>Bugs</li>
        <li>Calls</li>
        <li>Cases</li>
        <li>Contacts</li>
        <li>Contracts</li>
        <li>Custom modules (if applicable)</li>
        <li>Leads</li>
        <li>Meetings</li>
        <li>Notes</li>
        <li>Opportunities</li>
        <li>Targets</li>
        <li>Tasks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Users with an administrator or developer role can import records into the following admin-only modules:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Process Author modules:
            <ul>

    <h2 id="f-87f1-f338-50da-551b227d034a_Import_Guidelines">Import Guidelines</h2>
    <p>Importing is a very important process for both new Sugar users and those who have been using Sugar for years. Depending on your business needs, you may run imports anywhere from multiple times per week to only once or twice per year. Regardless of the import frequency, all users follow the same import guidelines:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>File Delimitation : </strong>Sugar accepts files that are delimited by a given separator, such as commas or tabs. The most common type of import will be using a CSV (Comma Separate Value) file, but Sugar will accept other file types as long as it recognizes the delimiter.</li>
        <li><strong>Imposed Limitations : </strong>Sugar, by default, does not impose any type of import imitations. However, System Administrators can impose a limit on the amount of rows or records that can be imported at one time. This limitation is found in Admin &gt; System Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Import - Maximum Number of Rows. Administrators can also limit what modules users are allowed to import into through the use of <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/032_Role_Management">Roles</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Scrub Data Before Import : </strong>It is strongly recommended that all data is reviewed and scrubbed before importing. It is much easier to see if you are importing good data or that you have removed all duplicates before importing than finding them after they are already in Sugar and are already in use by other users. In addition, you want to ensure standardized fields such as dates, phone numbers, etc. adhere to a common format so that the import will run as smooth as possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Parent Records First :</strong> When importing any records that use a relationship to another module, such as the Account - Contact relationship, it is best to try importing the parent, or higher level, records first. This is demonstrated with a one-to-many relationship between the two modules. In this case, it is best to import accounts first and then contacts, which rely on account records.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="f-87f1-f338-50da-551b227d034a_Importing_New_Records">Importing New Records</h2>
    <p>The first type of import that will be covered is importing new records. Whether you are just starting a migration from another CRM to Sugar or if you are adding a new list of records that you have received, such as a new list of leads or accounts, this process will help to get the data into Sugar without having to manually enter each record. After preparing your import file, follow these steps to import the list into Sugar:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Navigate to the module tab for the module that you are importing into and select the import option. This will open the Import Wizard and bring you to the"Upload Import File" screen. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/2576ee9a-8753-17da-21b3-550286362b17.png" alt="" width="207" height="208" /></li>
        <li>If you would like to review the Import File Template, you can download it from this page. This will give you a template of the format Sugar is going to be using to import your data. For more information on the template, please review the <a href="#f-87f1-f338-50da-551b227d034a_Import_File_Template">Import File Template</a> section of this documentation.</li>
        <li>Select the import file that you are going to use to import by clicking the Choose File button. When prompted, select the file from your computer and it will appear in this box. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a8a1937a-5bad-753b-0996-5502863d2d97.png" alt="" height="43" width="409" /></li>
        <li>Ensure that "Create new records only" is selected.</li>
        <li>If you have preformed imports before and have previously saved your import settings, you can select your setting at the bottom of the page using the "To use pre-set import settings, select from below" option. If you do not have any saved import settings, this section will not appear. For more information on saving mapping, please review the <a href="#f-87f1-f338-50da-551b227d034a_Saving_Field_Mappings">Saving Field Mappings</a> section of this documentation. <br /><span><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5708a468-dc67-d0bf-26f4-550286b42f2c.png" alt="" width="421" height="139" /></span></li>
        <li>Click "Next" to access the "Confirm Import File Properties" screen.</li>
        <li>This screen will show you the first two rows that Sugar is going to try to import as an example to let you know that your file was read properly by Sugar.</li>
        <li>The Import Wizard automatically detects the properties of the file that has been uploaded to ensure the best import possible. If you notice any mistakes or need to set up any advanced configuration, click "View Import File Properties". These changes are specific to the import and do not affect your standard user preferences. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/1449420a-00c5-2a0d-3fb8-5502861ef593.png" alt="" width="596" height="239" /></li>
        <li>If the file was exported from either Salesforce.com or Microsoft Outlook, select the corresponding option under "If the import file data was exported from any of the following sources, select which one". If not, leave this as "None"<strong>. </strong>This option will set up your mapping properly on the next screen.</li>
        <li>Click "Next" to access the Confirm Field Mappings screen.</li>
        <li>Click the View Notes button for any relevant information, specific to this module, to the import that you are performing. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/9a581684-0331-f1cc-1bee-550286bae868.png" alt="" width="138" height="127" /></li>
        <li>This screen presents you with four columns: <br /><strong><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b56a8312-0f52-527e-a82d-5502863d2588.png" alt="" width="572" height="63" /></strong><br /><strong>Header Row : </strong>This is the column header from your import file. This column will let you reference your file to make sure your column mapping is correct. If your import file does not have a header row, this column will not show. <br /><strong>Module Field : </strong>This column contains a dropdown list of all importable fields for the module. The Import Wizard tries to match the Header Row with the corresponding Sugar field. If the suggested mapping is incorrect, use the dropdown list to change the mapping. Required fields are marked with an asterisk (*). <br /><strong>Row 1 : </strong>This column contains the values from the first row of data in your import file. This is another aid to help ensure you have your mapping correct, so that you can see the mapping using real data and not just the headers. If your import file does not have column headers, there will be an additional column for Row 2. <br /><strong>Default Value : </strong>This column is hidden by default, but can be expanded if needed. When expanded, you have the option to fill in a value that will populate all records where a value for that field does not exist. For example, if you do not have anything populated in the Accounts Industry field, but you know this is a list of Technology companies, you can populate all blank values in the Industry field with the value of "Technology"<strong>. </strong></li>
        <li>Click "Add Field" if any data needs to be added to the import that is not on your import file. This can be used if you would like to assign a value to a record when the column is not on your import file. This is used in conjunction with the Default Value column. For example, if you are importing these accounts, but would like to assign them all to another user, John Smith, you would click the Add Field button, select the field from the Module Field column, and populate the desired value in the Default Value column. Now, all records will be assigned to John Smith upon import. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/1462cd0b-dc05-4abe-1ed4-550286a30007.png" alt="" width="600" height="306" /></li>
        <li>Click "Next" to access the Check for Possible Duplicates screen.</li>
        <li>This menu allows users to check if there are duplicated values on the import to records that already exist in Sugar. This menu will vary depending on what module you are importing into as the fields will be specific to this module. The fields available to the Import Wizard are determined based off the system-defined indexes. This is why you will not see all fields shown on this list, but only a subset of fields from the module. If you would like to cross reference existing Sugar records against what is being imported, simply drag and drop the field name from the right column, "Available Fields", to the left column, "Fields to Check".

        <li>The summary will tell you how many records were created, how many were not created due to an error, and how many were found as duplicates.</li>
        <li>There are three buttons below the Summary: <br /><strong>Undo Import : </strong>If there was a mistake in the import that you realized after importing, you can check this button. All records that were created via the import will be deleted. This button cannot be re-accessed for this import. As soon as you navigate away from this page, the import is considered complete. <br /><strong>Import Again : </strong>Click this button if you would like to go back to the first step of the Import Wizard and perform additional imports. Clicking this button will consider the import to be complete. <br /><strong>Exit : </strong>This button will also consider the import to be complete, but will bring you back to the module's list view to be able to further review or search your records.</li>
        <li>There are also three tabs on the summary page under the action buttons: <br /><strong>Created Records :</strong> This tab will show you a list view of all of the records that were properly imported on this import. <br /><strong>Duplicates :</strong> This tab will present you with any records that were not imported due to the Import Wizard finding duplicates from Step 15. There is an option to download a list of the duplicates, which produces a new CSV file. You have the option to download this list, make any changes, and import again following this same process. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/4a5702b0-72ca-cf23-76e1-550286ac9cf6.png" alt="" height="76" width="312" /><br /><strong>Errors</strong> : This tab will show you any records that were not imported due to an error during the import process. This is usually seen when there is a problem with data that is on one of the records or rows in the CSV file. For instance, if you are missing a value for a required field, or a field is formatted incorrectly. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/80b056a0-6802-a22e-ce6d-550286b9dc6c.png" alt="" height="128" width="457" /><br />Similar to the option to download duplicate records, you also have the option to download the list of errors using the two links provided. <br /><br />The "Download list of errors" option will produce a new CSV file with columns showing (from left to right) the error, the field affected, the value, and the line on your original import file where the error occurred. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/e920f265-e105-9c0d-8f1e-550286d2b4cd.png" alt="" height="47" width="464" /><br />The "Download list of rows that were not imported" option will download a new CSV file with the same format of your original one, containing only the rows that were not imported so that you can clean them up and then re-import. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b4ee69de-f802-feae-b8fa-55028614fc0a.png" alt="" height="57" width="433" /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/cfe5a28d-f427-0f6b-97eb-5502869f9cfd.png" alt="" width="550" height="251" /></li>

    <h2 id="f-87f1-f338-50da-551b227d034a_Importing_Updates_to_Existing_Records">Importing Updates to Existing Records</h2>
    <p>In addition to importing new records, Sugar's Import Wizard also has the functionality to use an import file to update existing Sugar records. The process runs very similar to the new record import process described above.</p>
    <p>The most important aspect to importing updates to existing records is that Sugar will only update records where there is a matching ID in the import file. Every Sugar record, regardless of what module it is in, is defined with an alphanumeric ID field. This field is typically a 36-character alphanumeric value but may be less if imported from a previous CRM. This field is the only way that the Import Wizard will know which record to update.</p>
    <p><strong>Note: </strong>All other fields (name, email address, etc.) are not considered unique and can have duplicates, so only the ID field will work to differentiate records for an update from import.</p>
    <p>The ID field is not usually shown within Sugar and must be found either by running a report or an export within the module.</p>
    <p>During the import, if there are any other records without ID fields and they are on the import file, they will create new records, which will create duplicates in your database.</p>
    <p>To import updates, follow the steps below.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>You will have to get the ID numbers for all of the records that you are going to be updating to prepare your import file. The most common methods are either by exporting a list of records from the module list view, or by running a report and exporting the results. For more information on exporting, please review the <a href="#e6004c-15af-3450-3b7e-551b22bbe5d2_Export">Export</a> documentation. <br /><strong>Export from List View :</strong> This option will include the record ID field, but it is recommended that you open the file in a spreadsheet editor (Microsoft Excel) and delete any columns that you are not updating. Be sure to leave the ID field and any required fields, such as Name, as the import will not complete without these. <br /><strong>Export from Report : </strong>If you choose to run a report, be sure to include the ID field in your display columns so that the records can be matched up. You will also want to include any required fields, such as Name, as the import will not complete without these. Please note that only Rows and Columns reports can be used for exports. <br />After you have your file ready for import, you can proceed with working through the Import Wizard.</li>
        <li>Navigate to the module tab for the module that you are updating and select the import option. This will open the Import Wizard and bring you to the<strong> "</strong>Upload Import File" screen. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/2576ee9a-8753-17da-21b3-550286362b17.png" alt="" width="207" height="208" /></li>
        <li>If you would like to review the Import File Template, you can download it from this page. This will give you a template of the format Sugar is going to be using to import your data. For more information on the template, please review the <a href="#f-87f1-f338-50da-551b227d034a_Import_File_Template">Import File Template</a> section of this documentation.</li>
        <li>Select the import file that you are going to use to import by clicking the "Choose File" button. When prompted, select the file from your computer and it will appear in this box. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a8a1937a-5bad-753b-0996-5502863d2d97.png" alt="" height="43" width="409" /></li>
        <li>Select the option "Create new records and update existing records".</li>
        <li>If you have performed imports before and have previously saved your import settings, you can select your setting at the bottom of the page using the "To use pre-set import settings, select from below" option. If you do not have any saved import settings, this section will not appear. If your CSV file was exported from Sugar, this is likely not a necessary step. For more information on saving mapping, please review the <a href="#f-87f1-f338-50da-551b227d034a_Saving_Field_Mappings">Saving Field Mappings</a> section of this documentation. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5708a468-dc67-d0bf-26f4-550286b42f2c.png" alt="" width="421" height="139" /></li>
        <li>Click "Next" to access the "Confirm Import File Properties" screen. Before the "Confirm Import File Properties" screen opens, you will be prompted with an alert informing you that updates made to existing records cannot be undone. Read, and then click "OK" to proceed.</li>
        <li>This screen will show you the first two rows that Sugar is going to try to import as an example to let you know that your file was read properly by Sugar.</li>
        <li>The Import Wizard automatically detects the properties of the file that has been uploaded to ensure the best import possible. If you notice any mistakes or need to set up any advanced configuration, click "View Import File Properties"<strong>. </strong>These changes are specific to the import and do not affect your standard user preferences. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/1449420a-00c5-2a0d-3fb8-5502861ef593.png" alt="" width="600" height="240" /></li>
        <li>If the file was exported from either Salesforce.com or Microsoft Outlook, select the corresponding option under "If the import file data was exported from any of the following sources, select which one"<strong>. </strong>If not, leave this as "None"<strong>. </strong>This option will set up your mapping properly on the next screen. If this file was exported from Sugar, keep it set to "None"<strong>.</strong></li>
        <li>Click "Next" to access theConfirm Field Mappings screen.</li>
        <li>Click the View Notes button for any relevant information, specific to this module, to the import that you are performing. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/9a581684-0331-f1cc-1bee-550286bae868.png" alt="" width="138" height="127" /></li>
        <li>This screen presents you with four columns: <br /><strong><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b56a8312-0f52-527e-a82d-5502863d2588.png" alt="" width="572" height="63" /></strong><br /><strong>Header Row : </strong>This is the column header from your import file. This column will let you reference your file to make sure your column mapping is correct. If your import file does not have a header row, this column will not show. <br /><strong>Module Field : </strong>This column contains a dropdown list for each row that contains the name of a field in Sugar. The Import Wizard tries to match the Header Row with the corresponding Sugar field. If the suggested mapping is incorrect, use the dropdown list to change the mapping. Required fields are marked with an asterisk (*). <br /><strong>Row 1 : </strong>This column contains the values from the first row of data in your import file. This is another aid to help ensure you have your mapping correct, so that you can see the mapping using real data and not just the headers. If your import file does not have column headers, there will be an additional column for Row 2. <br /><strong>Default Value : </strong>This column is hidden by default, but can be expanded if needed. When expanded, you have the option to fill in a value that will populate all records where a value for that field does not exist. For example, if you do not have anything populated in the Accounts Industry field, but you know this is a list of Technology companies, you can populate all blank values in the Industry field with the value of "Technology".</li>
        <li>Click "Add Field" if any data needs to be added to the import that is not on your import file. This can be used if you would like to assign a value to a record when the column is not on your import file. This is used in conjunction with the Default Value column. For example, if you are importing these accounts, but would like to assign them all to another user, John Smith, you would click Add Field button, select the field from the Module Field column, and populate the desired value in the Default Value column. Now, all records will be assigned to John Smith upon import. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/1462cd0b-dc05-4abe-1ed4-550286a30007.png" alt="" width="600" height="307" /></li>
        <li>Click "Next" to access the Check for Possible Duplicates screen.</li>
        <li>This menu allows users to check if there are duplicated values on the import to records that already exist in Sugar. Duplicate checking will only apply to new records created by the import.

        <li>The summary will tell you how many records were updated, how many were created, how many were not created due to an error, and how many were found as duplicates, as applicable.</li>
        <li>There are three buttons below the Summary: <br /><strong>Undo Import : </strong>If there was a mistake in the import of any new records that you realized after importing, you can check this button. All new records that were created via the import will be deleted. After updating, no changes to updated records can be reverted. This button cannot be re-accessed for this import.

        <li>There are also three tabs on the summary page under the action buttons: <br /><strong>Created Records :</strong> This tab will show you a list view of all of the records that were properly imported on this import. If this was only an update, there will not be any records showing on this tab as it does not show updated records. <br /><strong>Duplicates :</strong> This tab will present you with any records that were not imported due to the Import Wizard finding duplicates from Step 16. There is an option to download a list of the duplicates, which produces a new CSV file. You have the option to download this list, make any changes, and import again following this same process. If you did not use any duplicate settings, this tab will be empty. <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/4a5702b0-72ca-cf23-76e1-550286ac9cf6.png" alt="" height="76" width="312" /><br /><strong>Errors</strong> : This tab will show you any records that were not imported due to an error during the import process.

    <h2 id="f-87f1-f338-50da-551b227d034a_Importing_Fields_With_Multiple_Values">Importing Fields With Multiple Values</h2>
    <p>Multiselect fields allow for the input of multiple values. When importing data to these fields, it is possible to import multiple field values using a comma delimiter within the field.</p>
    <h3 id="f-87f1-f338-50da-551b227d034a_Importing_Multiselect_Fields_to_New_Records">Importing Multiselect Fields to New Records</h3>
    <p>To import multiple values to a multiselect field on a new record, the import data file's mapped column should contain exact character matches to existing dropdown values separated by a commas. For example, a multiselect field for Flavors contains the options Chocolate, Pistachio, Rocky Road, Spumoni, and Vanilla.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/dc911dfc-56dd-118d-d4a8-550286c48f79.png" alt="" width="242" height="223" /><br />To import a new record that contains both "Vanilla" and "Chocolate" in the Flavors field, the import data file's Flavors column should contain <code>Vanilla,Chocolate</code> with a comma separating the values and no extra spaces. If one of the imported multiselect options is a phrase, such as "Rocky Road", then the imported data field should contain a space character only within that value: <code>Vanilla,Chocolate,Rocky Road</code>.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b2fbaa6d-53f8-c2e6-9bd7-550286100856.png" alt="" width="418" height="130" /></p>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: The dropdown option display labels are not required to be unique, so best practice is to import the database values if they are known. For more information about how admin users can see database values and display labels for dropdown options, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/07_Developer_Tools/#Dropdown_Editor">Dropdown Editor</a> documentation in the Administration Guide.</p>
    <h3 id="f-87f1-f338-50da-551b227d034a_Importing_MultiselectFields_to_Existing_Records">Importing Multiselect Fields to Existing Records</h3>
    <p>Importing updates to the multiselect field of a record already existing in Sugar will erase any previous values and replace them with the imported values. If you wish to append new values to the existing values via import, you must first export the contents of the field for each record you will be updating, add the desired values to the existing values in by modifying the exported CSV file, then import the modified export file to Sugar.</p>
    <p>For example, imagine you would like to update 100 existing contact records. Each of the 100 contacts should have "Chocolate" added to the multiselect field "Flavors" without losing the data that is stored in the multiselect field already. The following steps explain how to append a multiselect field via import:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Export the list of 100 contacts that need to be updated.</li>
        <li>Preserve (at least) the Last Name, ID, and Flavors fields in the export file. The other field columns may be deleted.</li>
        <li>Sort the spreadsheet data by the Flavors column.</li>
        <li>Remove any rows from the file that already contain "Chocolate" as a value in the Flavors column.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/80252e70-03fd-460c-df73-5502867ba7e5.png" alt="" width="463" height="288" /></li>
        <li>If the Flavors column contains any empty cells, type the word <code>Chocolate</code> in those cells. In the remaining cells of the Flavors column, add <code>,Chocolate</code> (with a leading comma but no extra spaces) to the end of the existing character string.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/68940236-6572-f21e-a492-550286c7e916.png" alt="" width="578" height="160" /></li>
        <li>Save this file for import.</li>

    <h2 id="f-87f1-f338-50da-551b227d034a_Importing_Relationships">Importing Relationships</h2>
    <p>There are many situations where imports need to forge a relationship between two modules. A common example of this would be how importing contacts without an account name would leave the contacts orphaned and not linked to any parent account. To solve this problem, Sugar allows one-to-many and one-to-one relationships to be imported during the standard import process. The available fields will vary depending on the module being imported and will show on the <a href="#f-87f1-f338-50da-551b227d034a_Import_File_Template">Import Template</a> .</p>
    <p>Please note that when an opportunity is imported into Sugar, a revenue line item must also be imported and related to the opportunity in order to populate the amounts (e.g. best, likely, etc.) on the opportunity record. Be sure to include the opportunity ID and amounts on the revenue line item import file.</p>
    <p>When importing a relationship, Sugar will need the related record's unique ID, or, in some cases, will accept the record's Name field. Examples of the fields that relate one module to another are explained below.</p>

    <h2 id="f-87f1-f338-50da-551b227d034a_Import_File_Template">Import File Template</h2>
    <p>The Import File Template is a very useful tool for building your import file from another source or from scratch. The template for any module can be found on the Upload Import File page, which is either the first or second page of the wizard, depending on the module.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this file is to let you know what format Sugar is going to be looking for when you perform your import. The file contains all fields for a given module, regardless of if they show on any of your layouts. The file is also properly formatted and all settings are ready for the import. Upon opening the template, you will see a few example lines of either actual records from your instance, or, "demo data" if you have not yet performed an import. The template also contains instructions on how it is used.</p>
    <p>It is best to use the format supplied in this template whenever possible to make your import process as seamless as possible.</p>
    <h2 id="f-87f1-f338-50da-551b227d034a_Saving_Field_Mappings">Saving Field Mappings</h2>
    <p>When importing data, there can be times where you will be using the same import file format. If this file was not exported from Sugar, that likely means that you have to re-map most of the fields on the Confirm Field Mappings screen of the Import Wizard. To save time in the future, you can use the Import Wizard's pre-set import settings.</p>
    <p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/c2dc00eb-21c6-23de-40b8-55028629fee0.png" alt="" width="419" height="139" /></p>
    <p>On the "Check for Possible Duplicates" page of the wizard, which is the last page before performing your import, there is a text box where you can name the import settings that you have used on this import.<br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/7aaaf3e9-855c-1ed9-29df-55028645bd32.png" alt="" width="550" height="62" /></p>
    <p>Once you click "Import Now", this mapping will be saved and available for your use in future imports.</p>
    <p>This mapping is now saved for your user and will appear on the Upload Import File page of the Import Wizard. This will include two buttons for "Publish" and "Delete". <br /><strong><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/38030ffc-c014-21da-bd88-55028613a3ad.png" alt="" width="424" height="139" /></strong></p>
    <p><strong>Publish : </strong>Clicking this option will make your mapping available to all users. The Publish button will change to "Un-Publish" so that you can stop other users from using the template mapping. When it is published, it will appear as an option in the same section for other users when they perform an import.</p>
    <p><strong>Delete : </strong>This button will remove the pre-set import mapping for all users. This action cannot be undone.</p>
    <h2 id="f-87f1-f338-50da-551b227d034a_Detecting_Duplicates">Detecting Duplicates</h2>
    <p>During an Import, Sugar's Import Wizard includes the functionality to check for duplicate records. When enabled, Sugar will check to see if a record already exists in Sugar with the given criteria. When checking for duplicates, Sugar will mark any record as a duplicate if it cross references against any of the duplicate fields. For example, when importing Contacts, if you select Last Name and Email Address as your duplicate check fields, any record that has a matching last name and/or a matching email address to an existing contact in Sugar will be marked as a duplicate.</p>
    <p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/dd8eb20c-b75c-ddf4-bb7a-550286814a44.png" alt="" height="145" width="506" /></p>
    <p>The duplicate check fields used in each module differ depending on what fields are available to the module. Not all fields are used or available in the duplicate check and are pre-determined based off of system-defined indexes.</p>
    <p>If your import file has any duplicate records based off the fields you elect to verify against, the first record will be imported, and then all subsequent records in the file matching the duplicate criteria will be flagged.</p>
    <p>Any duplicates will show as such on the final page of the import. You will also have an option to download the duplicates so that they can be manually cross referenced to verify if they are actually duplicates. If they are not, simply re-run the import process without selecting any fields on the "Check for Possible Duplicates" page.</p>
    <h2 id="f-87f1-f338-50da-551b227d034a_External_Data_Sources">External Data Sources</h2>
    <p>When importing data to Sugar, there are other options than importing a data file exported from another source. Sugar offers an option to directly connect to an outside application or service though the Import Wizard and have Sugar pull the information directly from the source. This functionality is currently only available for Google Contacts.</p>
    <p>The import process is very similar to what is described above, but with some differences to speed up the process for users who would like to import all contact data into Sugar</p>

            <li>This will direct you to the "Confirm External Source Properties" page, which is very similar to the mapping screen from a data import from a file on your computer. Change any mapping necessary specific to your Google account and your Sugar instance. Any field in the Module Field column marked with an asterisk (*) is a required field and must be imported.</li>
            <li>There is no duplicate check for this type of import, but names and email addresses are automatically checked for duplicates.</li>
            <li>Click "Import Now" after you have completed your mapping.</li>
            <li>On the "View Import Results" screen, you will see that all of your Google contacts have been successfully imported into Sugar.</li>
            <li>Any records that were not imported due to error can be exported from Sugar and then re-imported if need be using the "Download list of rows that were not imported" link <br /><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/38e6917d-1050-b83b-67f9-55028610b3a2.png" alt="" width="345" height="258" /></li>

    <p>Sugar's Employees module consists of individual people within your organization. The Employees module allows you to see a list of all employees, their contact information, and their employment status in one convenient location. Employee records are typically created when a user record is created, but users with administrative access can also add non-user employees. This means that, typically, all users will be listed as employees, but not all employees are necessarily Sugar users.</p>
    <p>For more information on having administrators create employee records in Sugar, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/02_Sugar_Enterprise/Sugar_Enterprise_7.6/Administration_Guide/12_Employee_Records">Employee Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

    <p>The Employees module contains a number of stock fields which come out-of-the-box with Sugar. The below definitions are suggested meanings for the fields, but the fields can be leveraged differently to best meet your organization's needs. Users with administrator or developer access have the ability to alter, add, or remove fields via Admin &gt; Studio.

    <p>The Employees list view includes a Basic and Advanced Search to help you locate records easily and effectively in a module-specific manner. Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Employees list view below. Please note that Sugar automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %services). This will pull up any record that has the word "services" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p>
    <p>For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="#b9a9-b81d-6195-551b2230c636_Search">Search</a> documentation.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Search :</strong> Click the Search button or press your Return/Enter key to perform the search.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear</strong><strong>:</strong> Click the Clear button to clear all criteria from the searchable fields.</li>
        <li><strong>Active Employees : </strong>Select this box to return only records where Employee Status is Active.</li>

    <p>When you run a search, Sugar will return records matching all (as opposed to any) of the fields and checkboxes for which you have given a value. For example, if you select "Active Employees" and enter an employee's name, Sugar will only return employee records with a matching name that are active. Once the search is complete, the relevant results will populate in the <a href="#f0bd2-fae0-a747-f91c-551b22b46568_Employees_List_View">list view</a> below the search panel. To see all employee records, simply click "Clear" and then "Search" to perform a blank search with no filters.</p>

    <p>When you run a search, Sugar will return records matching all (as opposed to any) of the fields and checkboxes for which you have given a value. For example, if you select "Active Employees" and enter an employee's name, Sugar will only return employee records with a matching name that are active. Once the search is complete, the relevant results will populate in the <a href="#f0bd2-fae0-a747-f91c-551b22b46568_Employees_List_View">list view</a> below the search panel.

    <p>Please note that your ability to delete records in Sugar may be restricted by a role. For more information on roles, please refer to the Role Management documentation in the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/02_Documentation/01_Sugar_Editions/">Administration Guide</a> specific to your version and edition of Sugar.

    <p>Sugar's Processes module is the user-facing portal to <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.6/Ent/Administration_Guide/Process_Author">Sugar Process Author™</a>, a business process management tool which enables administrators to streamline common business processes by managing approvals, sales processes, call triaging, and more. A business process is a set of logically related tasks that are performed in order to achieve a specific organizational goal. It presents all of the tasks that must be completed in a simplified and streamlined format.</p>
    <p>Sugar Process Author empowers Sugar administrators to automate vital business processes for their organization. Some examples of business processes that can be automated using Sugar Process Author include invoice approvals, lead routing, customer service case routing, and automated reminders and escalations. This documentation will cover how to use the Processes module, as well as the various actions and options available from within the module. For more information on how administrators can create and configure processes, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.6/Ent/Administration_Guide/Process_Author/">Process Author</a> documentation in the Administration Guide.</p>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Sugar Process Author is exclusive to Enterprise and Ultimate editions of Sugar 7.6.x and later.</p>
    <h2 id="fc3478-55e3-77d0-7aae-5606f91e5827_Viewing_Processes">Viewing Processes</h2>
    <p>There are two places where regular users can view processes in Sugar: the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.6/Ent/Application_Guide/Processes/#Viewing_Via_Dashlet">Processes dashlet</a> and the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.6/Ent/Application_Guide/Processes/#Viewing_Via_List_View">Processes module list view</a>. The Processes module is the only Process Author module that is visible to regular users. From the Processes dashlet and module list view, you will only see running processes if there is anything for you to approve or review.</p>
    <h3 id="fc3478-55e3-77d0-7aae-5606f91e5827_Viewing_Via_Dashlet">Viewing Via Dashlet</h3>
    <p>All users who may be engaged in a process must place the Processes dashlet on their home screens. Process users will not receive an email notification when an activity is ready for them (unless the administrator has explicitly configured this). Instead, open, running processes waiting to be acted upon by the logged-in user will be listed in the Processes dashlet. This dashlet was designed to make it easy for users to know when it is their turn to participate in a process and to take the appropriate action.</p>
    <p><strong>Note: </strong>Users (including administrators) will see only the processes that immediately require their attention in the Processes dashlet.</p>
    <p>To add a Processes dashlet, please refer to the <a href="http://support.sugarcrm.com/Documentation/Sugar_Versions/7.6/Ent/Application_Guide/User_Interface/Intelligence_Pane/#Adding_Dashlets">Adding Dashlets</a> section of the Intelligence Pane documentation, choosing "Processes" from the Add a Dashlet page.

    <h2 id="fc3478-55e3-77d0-7aae-5606f91e5827_Executing_Processes">Executing Processes</h2>
    <p>When a running process requires action from a user, that user will see the process in their Processes dashlet and Processes module list view. These moments within a flow need a user to decide if a circumstance is approved or rejected, or review and/or edit a Sugar record. This decision is formally indicated by executing the process. The following sections explain how to execute the different process activities in Sugar.</p>
    <h3 id="fc3478-55e3-77d0-7aae-5606f91e5827_Executing_Approval_Processes">Executing Approval Processes</h3>
    <p>An approval process is a moment within a flow where a user must decide if a circumstance is approved or rejected. When an approval process requires action from a user, that user will see the process in their Processes dashlet and Processes module list view. The user will formally indicate their approval by executing the process.</p>
    <p>The most common user activity during a process is an approval. For example, an organization may require a different manager's approval depending on the discount total. The following image portrays how a Sugar process will automate this approval:
        <br><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/ae01a670-32c8-a2ca-004b-550305591c53.png" alt="approval-process" width="429" height="255"></p>
    <p>All steps in the above process are automated except for the two approval steps: "Needs Jim Approval" and "Needs Chris Approval". When the automated process reaches either of these steps, Jim or Chris will see a line item in their Processes dashlet and list view.</p>
    <p>Follow these steps to execute an approval process:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Click on the hyperlinked process name in your Processes dashlet. Please note that the dashlet will not differentiate between Approval processes and Routed processes. The process type will become apparent on the next screen.

In this situation, the process definition can be configured to route the process flow through the members of the executive team without requiring a conditional response. The following image portrays how a Sugar process will automate this procedure:

    <p>When a process is routed to you for review or approval, it may be possible to designate a new user to execute the process. The administrator can enable or disable this option on each process definition, so it may be possible to do this for one process but not another. If the option is enabled, "Select New Process User" will be available in the actions menu on the process execution screen:

    <p>A process user who is engaged in a process activity can add notes for people who will engage with the process later in its flow. When a different user engages in that same process later, he can see the earlier user notes and choose to add his own. Users who executed process activities at the beginning will not see the notes added by subsequent process users unless the process is routed back to them for review or approval later.</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Admin users can see all notes and add notes to any running process at any time from the Process Management page.</p>
    <p>To create a note and view process notes from other users, follow these steps:</p>

    <p>Every person that may be involved in a process will not see the process throughout its entire flow. Regular users can only see the process in list view when they have a record to approve, reject, or review. Therefore, only one regular user (non-admin) can see the notes at any given time. In other words, the notes will only be seen by users who approve/reject/review the process AFTER the note is added.</p>
