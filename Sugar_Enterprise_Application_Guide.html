        <h3 id="Logging_Out"><a name="Logging_Out" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Logging Out</h3>
        <p>When you are done working in Vodafone CRM and wish to log out of the system, simply click your user name on the upper right of Vodafone CRM and select "Log Out". This will log you out completely from Vodafone CRM and you must <a href="#Logging_In" class="selected">log in</a> again in order to access your account.
		</p>
        <p>
            <img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5091d1f2-48a5-3323-6fb0-550304ecb435.png" alt="" height="167" width="145" />

        <h4 id="Automatic_Log_Outs"><a name="Automatic_Log_Outs" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Automatic Log Outs</h4>
        <p>While working in Vodafone CRM, a user may be automatically logged out of the system. Currently, Vodafone CRM allows a username to be logged in under only one session, and any additional user sessions started using the same username will log out the previous session. This behavior is for your security as Vodafone CRM does not allow multiple sessions for the same username from different machines or browsers. To prevent situations like this, please do not share your login credentials (username and password) with users in your organization.</p>
        <p>Another situation where users are automatically logged out is when the user does not perform any actions in Vodafone CRM for a certain period of time. The security timeout period in Vodafone CRM is controlled by configuration settings in PHP and the web server running your Vodafone CRM instance. Please note that the PHP session's lifetime persists until you close your web browser and the default session timeout value is 1440 seconds (24 minutes).</p>
        <p>In order to prevent security timeouts, users can navigate or click the page(s) in Vodafone CRM every so often to keep the session active. If the session times out, click any button, tab, etc. on the current page once you are ready to continue working in Vodafone CRM, and you will be taken back to the <a href="#Logging_In" class="selected">Login screen</a>. Another option is to completely close your current browser and open a new browser to navigate back to Vodafone CRM's Login page.</p>
        <p>Please note that users can have multiple tabs of Vodafone CRM pages open within the same web browser (e.g. Chrome) without getting logged out of the system. For example, this is useful when working with multiple Vodafone CRM pages or records without navigating away from previous pages.</p>
        <h2 id="New_User_Wizard"><a name="New_User_Wizard" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>New User Wizard</h2>
        <p>When users first log in to Vodafone CRM, they will step through the New User Wizard to configure some basic settings (i.e. Your Information, Your Locale, etc.). If the system administrator already configured your basic settings when adding you as a user to Vodafone CRM, the fields in the wizard will be populated with the provided information. You can update your information as you go through the New User Wizard to make any necessary changes. Please note that you can skip the steps in the wizard if you wish to configure the settings via your user preferences at a later time.</p>
        <h3 id="Configuring_Your_Information"><a name="Configuring_Your_Information" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Configuring Your Information</h3>
        <p>The Your Information step of the New User Wizard allows you to enter basic information (e.g. name, email address, phone) about yourself to be stored in your user profile. Please note that the information provided on this step can be updated in your user preferences at a later time if desired. For more information on configuring your personal information, please refer to the <a href="#User_Preferences" class="selected">User Preferences</a> section of this documentation.</p>
        <p>The following options are available to configure your user profile:</p>

            <li value="4"><strong>Phone</strong> : Enter your office number.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please note that all required fields will indicate "Required" in the field and must be completed prior to moving to the next step of the wizard. Once your personal information is entered, click "Next".</p>

        <h3 id="Configuring_Your_Locale"><a name="Configuring_Your_Locale" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Configuring Your Locale</h3>
        <p>The User Locale Settings step allows you to configure the date, time, and name format you want displayed in Vodafone CRM based on your current geographical location.

Only system administrators have the ability to create roles and assign them to users. Users who are assigned to the role will only be able to perform actions defined by it. Please note that users with more than one role assigned will have the more restrictive role setting prevail on the access table. For example, if one role allows the user to delete records in the Contacts module, but the other role does not allow record deletion, the user will not be able to delete records in the Contacts module. The table will list the modules in rows on the far left with column headers representing the type of action (e.g. Delete, Edit, Export, etc.) users can perform in each module. </p>
        <p>The following setting options are available for the Access column on the table:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><strong>Enabled </strong>: The user is allowed access to this module.</li>
            <li value="2"><strong>Not Set</strong> : Does not restrict or grant access to this module, defaults to having "Enabled" access when selected.</li>

        <p>Vodafone CRM Roles define permissions for users such as what kinds of records they can access and what level of access they are allowed . Roles work in conjunction withteams to form a robust security model for non-admin users in Vodafone CRM. Roles control three different layers of access for users within Vodafone CRM: module, field, and action-level access. Please note that only users who are assigned to the specific role will be able to perform actions (e.g. view, edit, delete, etc.) defined by it. For more information on the various actions and setting options for roles, please refer to the <a href="#Access_Table" class="selected">Access Table</a> section of this documentation. Users who arenot assigned to a role can access and perform actions in any module as long as they are assigned to the record or a member of the team assigned to manage it. </p>
        <p>The Roles section displays the list of roles (if any) assigned to the user. Please note that if you are assigned to more than one role, the more restrictive role setting prevails. For example, if you have two roles where one role allows exporting of records in the Leads module and the other does not, then you will not be able to export lead records due to the more restrictive role setting.</p>

        <h4 id="My_Teams"><a name="My_Teams" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>My Teams</h4>
        <p>Teams consist of one or more users who are assigned to manage records in Vodafone CRM. The defined permissions determine what records a user is and is not able to access. Teams are used in conjunction withroles to form a robust security model for non-admin users in Vodafone CRM. The My Teams section displays the list of teams a user is associated with, which determines what records the user has access to in Vodafone CRM. Please note that every record is assigned to at least one team, but can be assigned to multiple teams as well if different users need access to it. The default team(s) set in the User Settings section under the Advanced tabwill automatically be assigned to new records created by the user. Users assigned to the record, as well as system administrators can access the record regardless of team membership. When a user is created in Vodafone CRM, they are automatically associated to the Global team (universal team) and a Private team (users own personal team) is created by default. <img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5db8a542-71e2-2c68-190b-550304804a62.png" alt="" width="282" height="119" /></p>

        <p>Clicking on an item in the Quick Create menu will open the record view form for the specific module. When using quick create to make a record while viewing an existing record of another module where there is a relationship between the two modules, Vodafone CRM automatically creates a relationship between both records. For example : if you are viewing an account record (e.g. ABC Company) and create a new contact via the quick create form, the Account Name field in the contact record will automatically populate with "ABC Company", thus creating the link between the two records. All required fields will indicate "Required" in the field and must be completed prior to saving. </p>

        <h3 id="Module_Search"><a name="Module_Search" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Module Search</h3>
        <p>Module search enables users to easily search by the record's name within the module and pull up matching records in the list view. The search also provides a Filter option allowing you to narrow your search further using the available options as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><strong>Create</strong> : Create a new custom filter which you can use to filter your search</li>
            <p><strong>Note</strong>: You can also click "Create" to the right of the Filter option.</p>
            <li value="2"><strong>All "Module Name"</strong> : Returns all records in the module (e.g. Accounts) to which you have access</li>
            <li value="3"><strong>My "Module Name"</strong> : Returns only records assigned to you</li>
            <li value="4"><strong>My Favorites</strong> : Returns only records you have marked as favorites</li>
            <li value="5"><strong>Recently Created </strong>: Returns only records you created in the module within the last 7 days</li>
            <li value="6"><strong>Recently Viewed </strong>: Returns only records you have viewed in the module within the last 7 days</li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <p>When you choose a filter, Vodafone CRM will return record's which match both the selected filter and any name provided in the open Search box in the filtered list view results. For example, if you select "My Accounts" in the Filter options and enter an account name, Vodafone CRM will only return account records with a matching name that are assigned to you. Once the search is complete, the relevant results will populate in the <a href="#List_View" class="selected">list view</a> below the search bar. To see all account records to which you have access, simply select the All Accounts option in the filter and remove any text from the search bar. You can also click the Clear icon within the selected filter option (e.g. My Accounts) in the Search bar to clear the filter and pull up all list view search results. When you run a search using a saved or created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. In addition, searches using the open Search box only or in combination with advanced filters (e.g. My Favorites) are preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter. </p>

        <p>Users can also create new filters via the Create option in the Filter list of the search bar. This allows users to add custom, complex filter options when searching in the module's list view. You have the option to add multiple fields to your new filter by clicking the Plus button to the right of the filter selection dropdown lists and set select operators along with their value(s). A filter's criteria need to be true for a record in order for it to appear in the list view search result. Additionally, filters with no specified values may be saved as a custom filter to act as a filter template when a user often searches using the same fields but with varying values. Please note that only fields you have view access for will appear in the Filter list when creating a search filter.</p>
        <p>When you run a search using a created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the module. Returning to the list view will automatically display the results of your last filter.</p>

            </p>
            <li value="2">Select the field you wish to add to your filter, as well as the condition and matching criteria.</li>
            <p><strong>Note</strong>: Only fields you have view access for will be available to add in the Filter list.</p>
            <li value="3">For Integer type fields (e.g. case number), you can select the "is any of" operator to pull up records that match any one of the set values (e.g. 100, 200, 300, etc.) in the search criteria.</li>
            <li value="4">To add additional fields to the new filter, click the Plus button to the right of the filter.</li>
            <li value="5">To remove fields from the new filter, click the Minus button to the right of the filter.</li>
            <li value="6">To clear any filter values (e.g. Will Westin), simply click the "x" to the right of the value or select "Reset" to the left of the Save button.</li>

        <p>Saving a filter will preserve the chosen fields as well as the condition(s) of the matching value(s). Additionally, it will allow users to easily select previously created and saved filters from the Filter options.</p>
        <p>The following steps cover saving a new search by Name filter for the Accounts module as an example:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Create a <a href="#Creating_a_Filter" class="selected">new filter</a> to perform a search on your desired fields.</li>

        <h4 id="Delete"><a name="Delete" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Delete</h4>
        <p>Users have the ability to delete record's that are invalid or should no longer appear in their organization's Vodafone CRM instance via the module's list view. Deleting via the list view allows for mass deleting multiple records at once as well as single record deletions. Please note that deleting records will not delete the related records and will only remove the relationship, so you may wish to also delete any related records to avoid orphaned records.</p>
        <p>Please note that your ability to delete records in Vodafone CRM may be restricted by a role. Check with your system administrator if you do not see the Delete options.</p>
        <p>The following steps cover deleting account records from the Accounts list view as an example:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Navigate to the Accounts list view by clicking the Accounts module tab.</li>
            <li value="2">Use the <a href="#Module_Search" class="selected">Module Search</a> to find the Account records you wish to delete.</li>
            <li value="3">Select the desired account records then choose "Delete" from the Actions menu.</li>
            <p>You can also click the Record Actions menu to the far right of the record's row and select "Delete" to delete individual records from the list view.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/afbfc7f7-a9e4-7ab9-357a-5502869b5b78.png" alt="" width="342" height="388" />
            </p>
            <li value="4">A pop-up message will display asking for confirmation. Click "Confirm" to proceed.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Vodafone CRM allows you to select up to 1000 records at a time for deletion. If you desire to delete more than 1000 records, you will need to perform the deletions in several batches.</p>
        <h4 id="Export"><a name="Export" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Export</h4>
        <p>Vodafone CRM's Export option allows users to download all fields for the selected records to their computers as a .CSV (comma-separated values) file. This may be useful when needing to use data with other software such as Microsoft Excel or to update existing records by exporting, making changes, then importing the altered records back into Vodafone CRM. For more information on updating existing records via import, please refer to the <a href="#Importing_Updates_to_Existing_Records" class="selected">Import</a> documentation. Due to PHP memory limitations on the server, there may be occasions when the application times out while exporting a large number of records. If you encounter an error when performing this action, we recommend selecting the records in smaller batches.</p>
        <p>Records may be exported from the list view by selecting "Export" from the Actions menu. Users with access to the Reports module also have the option of creating or accessing reports containing specifically chosen fields for records and their related record(s). Please note that only Rows and Columns-type reports have the ability to be exported. For more information on exporting records in Vodafone CRM, please refer to the <a href="#Export" class="selected">Export</a> documentation. </p>

        <h3 id="Favorite_Designation"><a name="Favorite_Designation_..86" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Favorite Designation</h3>
        <p>Users have the option to mark records as favorites via the module list view. This allows users to designate records that are important or will be viewed often so that they can easily be accessed via the search filter's My Favorites option or from the module tab's Favorites option. In the module's list view, the star on the left of each record's row is orange once marked to indicate a favorite record.</p>
        <p>The following steps cover marking records as favorites via the Accounts list view as an example:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Navigate to the Accounts list view by clicking the Accounts module tab.</li>
            <li value="2">Use the <a href="#Module_Search" class="selected">Module Search</a> to find the Account records you wish to mark as favorites.</li>
            <li value="3">Mark the star icon on the left of each desired account's row.</li>
            <li value="4">To remove the account as a favorite, click the star again to revert it to gray. </li>

        <h3 id="Following_Designation"><a name="Following_Designation_..87" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Following Designation</h3>
        <p>Users can also choose to follow specific records to which they have access to in Vodafone CRM by selecting "Follow" in the Record Actions menu on the list view. The ability to follow records allows each user to personalize their activity stream by specifying which records' posts should appear on the activity streams displayed on their Home page and module list view. Please note that you will automatically follow records that you create as well as records that are assigned to you. You will not, however, automatically follow records you import. Should a user lose access to a record in Vodafone CRM, they will automatically stop following that record.</p>
        <p>The following steps cover marking a record to follow via the Accounts list view as an example:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Navigate to the Accounts list view by clicking the Accounts module tab.</li>
            <li value="2">Use the <a href="#Module_Search" class="selected">Module Search</a> to find the Account records you wish to follow.</li>
            <li value="3">Click the Record Actions menu to the far right of the records row and select "Follow".</li>
            <li value="4">To unfollow the account, click the Record Actions menu then select "Unfollow". </li>

        <h4 id="Find_Duplicates"><a name="Find_Duplicates" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Find Duplicates</h4>
        <p>Between multiple users working in Vodafone CRM, importing new records, and converting leads, it is possible for duplicate records to be accidentally input to the system. Before creating a new record, a good practice is to first check that the record does not already exist in Vodafone CRM. You can locate duplicate records for cleanup using <a href="#Module_Search" class="selected">module search</a> from the list view. Searching for records with similar names or other information can turn search into a powerful, duplicates-finding tool. Vodafone CRM also provides a wizard for finding potential duplicates that is available from the record view and may be used as shown below. If duplicate records are detected, you can perform a merge per the <a href="#Merging" class="selected">Merging</a> section of this documentation.</p>
        <p>Use the following steps to locate duplicate records using the Find Duplicates option from the record view:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Navigate to a record view.</li>
            <li value="2">Choose "Find Duplicates" from the Actions menu. </li>
            <p>
                <img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/33a21e8b-f617-7abf-451b-550286076898.png" alt="" width="400" height="139" />
            </p>
            <li value="3">Potential duplicate records will be listed on the Find Duplicates page. Select the duplicate record(s) you wish to merge then click "Merge Duplicates".</li>
            <li value="4">You can preview the duplicate record's details by clicking the Preview button to the far right of the records row.</li>
            <li value="5">You can search for specific records from the list view if you wish to check for more possible duplicates. For more information on performing a search, please refer to the <a href="#Module_Search" class="selected">Module Search</a> section of this documentation.</li>
            <li value="6">You can also click the Column Selection icon above the Preview button to change the list of fields that display on the list view column headers.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Once you click "Merge Duplicates", the merging process with the current record will begin. For instructions on performing the merge that follows, please refer to Steps 3-8 of the <a href="#Merging_Via_List_View" class="selected">Merging Via List View</a> section of this documentation.</p>
        <h4 id="Copy"><a name="Copy" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Copy</h4>
        <p>Users can create new record's by duplicating an existing record from the record view. The copy option is useful if the record you are creating has similar information to an existing record. Please note that related records to the original record will not be copied to the newly created record.</p>
        <p>The following steps cover creating a contact by duplicating an existing record as an example:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Navigate to a contact's record view.</li>
            <li value="2">Click the Actions menu and select "Copy". </li>

        <p>Users can easily view quick details for the various related activities (e.g. calls, meetings, notes, emails, etc.) that have taken place via the Historical Summary option. Simply navigate to the module's (e.g. Accounts) record view and select "Historical Summary" from the Actions menu to view the historical activities related to the record in one place.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/aa972a60-d4e8-5495-0fe3-5502869f0e64.png" alt="" width="429" height="231" />
        </p>
        <p>The Historical Summary page will display each activity's subject, type, status, date created, etc. and you can simply click the activity's name to view the full details for each activity. You can also preview the activity record via the intelligence pane by clicking the Preview icon to the far right of each record's row. It will provide users with key information regarding the record as well as the related activity stream information (if any). For more information on activity streams, please refer to the <a href="#Activity_Streams" class="selected">Activity Streams</a> documentation. Please note that preview is only available for modules (e.g. Task, Note) using the Sidecar user interface.</p>
        <p>The historical summary list view provides the ability to reorder columns by dragging and dropping the title of the column to the desired location. The new column order will remain for a user upon subsequent visits to the module until the user's browser cache is cleared. You can reset the column order back to the default view by clicking the Gear icon to the far right of the list view column headers and selecting "Reset default view". Please note that this option only appears if the current list view column order is different from the system's default column order.</p>
        <p>Users can also easily adjust the size of columns in the historical summary list view per their viewing preference. Simply place your cursor on the column divider, and when the Left and Right arrow appears, click and drag the column to the desired size. The set column width will be preserved when you navigate away from the page. Vodafone CRM will render the preferred column size across sessions until the user removes or resets the relevant browser cookies. You can reset the column width back to the default size by clicking the Gear icon to the far right of the list view column headers and selecting "Reset default widths". Please note that this option only appears if at least one of the column widths in the Historical Summary list view is different from the default column width.</p>

        <h4 id="Delete"><a name="Delete_..90" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Delete</h4>
        <p>Users have the ability to delete record's that are invalid or should no longer appear in their organization's Vodafone CRM instance via the module's record view. Deleting via the record view allows you to delete a single record in the module. Please note that deleting records will not delete the related records and will only remove the relationship, so you may wish to also delete any related records to avoid orphaned records.</p>
        <p>Please note that your ability to delete records in Vodafone CRM may be restricted by a role. </p>
        <p>The following steps cover deleting an account record from the Accounts record view as an example:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Navigate to an account's record view.</li>
            <li value="2">Select "Delete" from the Actions menu.</li>

        <h3 id="Favorite_Designation"><a name="Favorite_Designation_..91" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Favorite Designation</h3>
        <p>Users have the option to mark records as favorites via the module's record view. This allows users to designate records that are important or will be viewed often so that they can easily be accessed via the search filter or from the module tab. In the module's record view, the star to the right of the record's name is orange once favorited.</p>
        <p>

        <h3 id="Following_Designation"><a name="Following_Designation_..92" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Following Designation</h3>
        <p>Users can also choose to follow specific records to which they have access to in Vodafone CRM by clicking the Follow button (If grayed out) to the right of the record's name. The ability to follow records allows each user to personalize their activity stream by specifying which records' posts should appear on the activity streams displayed on their Home page and module list view. Please note that you will automatically follow records that you create as well as records that are assigned to you. You will not, however, automatically follow records you import. Should a user lose access to a record in Vodafone CRM, they will automatically stop following that record.</p>
        <p>The following steps cover marking a record to follow via the Contacts record view:</p>

        <h3 id="Twitter_Connector"><a name="Twitter_Connector" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Twitter Connector</h3>
        <p>Vodafone CRM comes with built in connectors to external data sources to enable you to connect your Vodafone CRM data to common social media platforms (e.g. Twitter). These integration's can help to bring you closer to your customers and partners using social media. For more information on what connectors are available and how to enable and configure them, please refer to the <a href="Sugar_Enterprise_Administration_Guide.html#Connectors">Connectors</a> section in the System documentation of the Administration guide.</p>
        <p>Users can view and access twitter feeds in Vodafone CRM as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Add and share twitter feeds via Vodafone CRM's <a href="#Activity_Streams" class="selected">Activity Streams</a></li>
            <li value="2">View twitter feeds via the Twitter dashlet on Vodafone CRM's <a href="#Home" class="selected">Home page</a> and <a href="#Intelligence_Pane" class="selected">Intelligence Pane</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please note that administrators must first configure the Twitter connector before users can view twitter feeds via the Twitter dashlet. For more information on how to configure the Twitter connector, please refer to the <a href="Sugar_Enterprise_Administration_Guide.html#Connectors">Connectors</a> section in the System documentation.</p>
        <p>The following steps cover adding the Twitter ID to view feeds via the Account record views intelligence pane as an example:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">Navigate to an account record view's intelligence pane and verify that the Twitter dashlet is there.</li>
            <li value="2">If the Twitter dashlet is not displayed in the intelligence pane, you can add the dashlet by editing the dashboard. For more information on adding dashlets, please refer to <a href="#Adding_Dashlets" class="selected">Adding Dashlets</a> section of the Intelligence Pane documentation.</li>
            <li value="3">View the record's details and locate the Twitter Account field. Click the Pencil icon to the left of the Twitter Account field and enter in a Twitter ID. Click "Save" to preserve the change.</li>
            <p>

        <p>Once the Twitter ID is saved on the record view, navigate to the Twitter dashlet in the intelligence pane to view the associated twitter feeds for the account.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/b3b6b388-854a-27e9-b909-550286fb0ed7.png" alt="" width="675" height="229" />
        </p>
        <p>Please note that if the Twitter ID is not entered in the Twitter Account field, then the Twitter connector will try to pull feeds by finding a match based on the record's name (account name, contact name, etc.). Also, if there is a custom field <a href="Sugar_Enterprise_Administration_Guide.html#Mapping_Connector_Fields">mapped</a> to Twitter, the Twitter Account field will still be verified first to see if there is a valid Twitter ID and the Twitter dashlet will pull feeds using this account. If the Twitter Account field is blank, then it will check the custom field that is mapped and pull feeds based on the Twitter ID entered. If both fields are blank, then it will check the record's name to try and find a matching account to pull twitter feeds. For more information on mapping connector fields, please refer to the <a href="Sugar_Enterprise_Administration_Guide.html#Mapping_Connector_Fields">System</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>
        <p>Twitter dashlets on the Home page and module's list view need to have a valid Twitter ID associated in order to display the feeds. Simply click the Gear icon on the upper right of the dashlet, select "Edit", and enter the appropriate Twitter ID. Save the change and the corresponding twitter feeds will display in the dashlet.</p>
        <h3 id="DB_Connector"><a name="D&amp;B_Connector" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>D&amp;B Connector</h3>
        <p>The D&amp;B connector allows users to search, view, access, and import key information for companies via various D&amp;B dashlets in the Account record view's intelligence pane. Please note that administrators must first configure the D&amp;B connector via Admin &gt; Connectors before users can utilize the dashlets in the Accounts module. For more information on how to configure the D&amp;B connector, please refer to the <a href="Sugar_Enterprise_Administration_Guide.html#Connectors">Connectors</a> section in the System documentation of the Administration guide. Once the connector is enabled, users can add the appropriate D&amp;B dashlets to the account record view's intelligence pane.

        <p>Beneath the module (e.g. Accounts) record's fields are subpanels containing related records from various modules (e.g. Contacts, Leads, Opportunities, etc.). You can create a related record as well as link an existing record directly from the subpanel. Once the records appear within the subpanel, users can preview the record's detail and edit the record's data directly from the record view. Please note that the subpanels are viewable when you access the Data View section of the module's record view.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/ca8201b4-c8bf-195b-a821-55028651001d.png" alt="" width="468" height="224" />
        </p>
        <h4 id="Filter_Options"><a name="Filter_Options" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Filter Options</h4>
        <p>While in Data View, all of the module record's related records will be displayed beneath the record's fields. Users have the ability to search for records which appear in the subpanels as well as filter the view to only display a specific module (e.g. Leads, Contacts, etc.). To locate a record by name, enter the keyword into the Search bar, and the subpanel(s) with the matching record(s) will appear below. To filter, simply click the Related option to the far left of the Search bar and select the module whose subpanel you wish to view. Filter and search may be combined to only display matching records within a selected module. To see all subpanels to which you have access, simply select "All" in the Related options and remove any text from the search bar. When you run a search using a saved or created filter, the search will be preserved when you navigate away from the page. In addition, searches using the open Search box only or in combination with advanced filters (e.g. My Favorites) are preserved when you navigate away from the page.</p>
        <p>When a Sidecar module (e.g. Contacts, Leads, Tasks, etc.) is selected from the Related options, you have the option to filter the related subpanels further using one of the available options (e.g. My Favorites, Recently Created, etc.). Please note that you can also create custom filters for related Sidecar modules. Once the related module (e.g. Contacts) is selected, either click the Filter option and select "Create" or click "Create" to the right of the Filter option. </p>

        <h4 id="Related_Record_Subpanels"><a name="Related_Record_Subpanels" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Related Record Subpanels</h4>
        <p>The most common type of subpanels displayed on a module's record view contain the related records belonging to various modules. The relationship type determines whether a related record will be displayed in the field listing or in a subpanel. For example, an account may be related to multiple contacts which means that the related contacts will be displayed in a subpanel beneath the fields.</p>
        <p>Related record subpanels allow the following operations to be performed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">To view the details of a related record, click the record's name in the subpanel to open it in record view.</li>
            <li value="2">To relate an existing record, choose "Link Existing Record" from the subpanel's Actions menu, then locate and select the desired record. Please note that the Link Existing Record option is not available when the relationship is required in the related module (e.g. Account Name field in Opportunities).</li>
            <li value="3">To relate a new record, click the Plus button to the left of the Actions menu, then complete the record view layout and click "Save".</li>
            <li value="4">To inline edit the record directly from the subpanel, choose "Edit" from the Actions menu on the far right of the record's row and click "Save" to preserve the change.</li>
            <li value="5">To preview the record, click the Preview button to the far right of the record's row. The record's details will display to the right of the module's record view.</li>
            <li value="6">To delete an existing relationship to a record, choose "Unlink" from the Actions menu on the far right of the record's row. This removes the relationship, but does not delete the record itself. Please note that the Unlink option is not available when the relationship is required in the related module (e.g. Account Name field in Opportunities).</li>
            <li value="7">To mark the record as a favorite, click the star icon to the left of the desired record's row.</li>
            <li value="8">To collapse or expand the subpanel, click the Up arrow to the left of the Plus button.</li>
            <li value="9">To change the column size in the subpanel, place your cursor on the column divider, and when the Left and Right arrow appears, click and drag the column to the desired size.</li>
            <p><strong>Note</strong>: The subpanel column width will not be preserved when you navigate away from the page.</p>

        <h2 id="Overview"><a name="Overview_..101" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Overview</h2>
        <p>The user interface in Vodafone CRM is essentially everything you see and can interact within Vodafone CRM. Knowing what buttons allow you to do what actions and how to quickly add and edit information is critical to managing your customer information. This documentation is divided into related sections in order to cover in detail, interface options to perform specific tasks.</p>
        <h2 id="Legacy_Modules"><a name="Legacy_Modules" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Legacy Modules</h2>
        <p>Below is a list of modules which use the Legacy user interface. Other modules use the updated Sidecar user interface which is described in detail in the <a href="#User_Interface" class="selected">User Interface</a> documentation.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Calendar</li>
            <li value="2">Campaigns</li>
            <li value="3">Contracts</li>
            <li value="4">Documents</li>
            <li value="5">Emails</li>
            <li value="6">Knowledge Base</li>
            <li value="7">Quotes</li>
            <li value="8">Reports</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note</strong>: Custom modules that are created in Module Builder will utilize the Sidecar user interface. Custom modules installed to an instance prior to Vodafone CRM 7 that were not created in Module Builder will use the Legacy user interface upon upgrade to 7.x.</p>
        <h2 id="List_View"><a name="List_View_..102" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>List View</h2>
        <p>Each module in Vodafone CRM contains a list view to search and display records in a table format. To access a module's list view, simply click the module tab (e.g. Calls) in the navigation bar at the top of Vodafone CRM. </p>
        <p>The list view displays all records meeting the current search criteria and to which your user has access. By default, Vodafone CRM sorts records in descending order of their creation date. You can view the basic details of each record within the field columns or select the record name to view it in the detail view. </p>
        <p>Please note that you will only be able to see records as allowed by your team membership, user access type, and assigned roles. For more information on teams and roles, please refer to the <a href="Sugar_Enterprise_Administration_Guide.html#031_Team_Management">Team Management</a> and <a href="Sugar_Enterprise_Administration_Guide.html#032_Role_Management">Role Management</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p>

        <p>You have the option to change what fields are displayed in each module's list view by configuring your layout options in the Advanced Search. For more information on configuring your list view, please refer to the <a href="#Layout_Options" class="selected">Layout Options</a> section of the Search documentation.</p>
        <h3 id="Basic_Search"><a name="Basic_Search" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Basic Search</h3>
        <p>The basic search is at the top of the list view for each module and offers a few, commonly used fields for a simplified search experience. From the Basic Search panel, you can click "Advanced Search" to access additional search functionality as needed.</p> <p>The following buttons and checkboxes are common across many Legacy modules' Basic Search panel and have the following functions:</p><ul><li value="1"><strong>Search</strong> : Click the Search button or press your Return/Enter key to perform the search.</li><li value="2"><strong>Clear</strong> : Click the Clear button to clear all criteria from the searchable fields.</li><li value="3"><strong>My Items</strong> : Select this box to return only records assigned to you.</li><li value="4"><strong>My Favorites</strong> : Select this box to return only records you have marked as favorites.</li><li value="5"><strong>Open Items</strong> : Select this box to return only records with an open status (e.g. Planned).</li></ul><p>When you run a search, Vodafone CRM will return records matching all (as opposed to any) of the fields and checkboxes for which you have given a value. For example, if you select "My Items" and enter a name or subject, Vodafone CRM will only return records with a matching name or subject that are assigned to you. Once the search is complete, the relevant results will populate in the list view below the search panel. To see all records to which you have access within the module, simply click "Clear" and then "Search" to perform a blank search with no filters. </p><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/200561f8-fc0b-76ed-71e1-55030464265b.png" alt="" width="672" height="79" /></p><h3 id="Advanced_Search"><a name="Advanced_Search" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Advanced Search</h3><p>Advanced Search offers a more in-depth search experience than Basic Search including additional fields, layout options, and saved search capability. From the Advanced Search panel, you can click "Basic Search" for simplified searching.</p><p>The following buttons, checkboxes, and dropdowns are common across many Legacy modules' Advanced Search and have the following functions:</p><ul><li value="1"><strong>Search</strong> : Click the Search button or press your Return/Enter key to perform the search.</li><li value="2"><strong>Clear</strong> : Click the Clear button to clear all criteria from the searchable fields.</li><li value="3"><strong>My Favorites</strong> : Select this box to return only records you have marked as favorites.</li><li value="4"><strong>Layout Options</strong> : Use the expandable Layout Options section to configure your list view.

For more information, please refer to the <a href="#Saved_Search" class="selected">Saved Search</a> section of the Search documentation.</li></ul><p>When you run a search, Vodafone CRM will return records matching all (as opposed to any) of the fields for which you have given a value. For example, if you select "My Favorites" and enter in a field to search, Vodafone CRM will only return records matching that field that you have marked as favorites. When searching by a multiselect or dropdown field (i.e. "Assigned to"), however, Vodafone CRM will return records matching any of these selections. Once the search completes, the relevant results will populate in the list view below the search panel.

Please note that deleted records are not permanently removed from the database, but are marked as deleted in the system so that it no longer appears in Vodafone CRM. These records can be recovered by anyone with direct database access. Also, deleting records in Vodafone CRM will not delete the related records and will only remove the relationship, so you may wish to also delete any related records to avoid orphaned records.</p><p>The following steps cover deleting call records via the Calls list view as an example:</p><ol><li value="1">Navigate to the Calls list view by clicking the Calls module tab.</li><li value="2">Use the <a href="#Basic_Search" class="selected">Basic</a> or <a href="#Advanced_Search" class="selected">Advanced Search</a> to find the Call records you wish to delete.</li><li value="3">Select the desired call records individually or using the <a href="#Selecting_Records" class="selected">checkbox dropdown's</a> options.</li><li value="4">Choose "Delete" from the Actions menu.</li><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/81ae70d7-9b17-be90-6348-55028bcf6793.png" alt="" height="169" width="273" /></p><li value="5">A pop-up message will display asking for confirmation.

The subpanels that appear in a record's detail view is based on the relationships defined for the current module as well as the administrative settings on which subpanels are set to display in Vodafone CRM. You can expand and collapse subpanels as well as rearrange them per your viewing preference. For more information on changing the display of subpanels, please refer to the <a href="#Layout" class="selected">Layout</a> section of this documentation. You can create related records as well as relate an existing record directly from the subpanel. Please note that the actions available in the Actions menu can vary between certain subpanels (e.g. Activities, History).</p><h4 id="Activities_and_History"><a name="Activities_and_History" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Activities and History</h4><p>The Activities and History subpanels are special subpanels in Vodafone CRM that show data from multiple modules based on certain criteria. For example, a meeting with a status of "Planned" will appear in the Activities subpanel. Once the meeting is changed to a status of "Held", it will move from the Activities subpanel to the History subpanel. All related note and email records will appear in the History subpanel as there are no filters on those modules, but notes and emails will never display in the Activities subpanel. If you customize the status field for any of the modules, the records that hold a custom status will appear in the Activities subpanel. But code level customizations would be required to have a new status show in the History subpanels.</p> <p>Please refer to this chart for the criteria both subpanels use to query data:</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Subpanel</strong></td><td><strong>Module</strong></td><td><strong>Status Field Filter</strong></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="6"><p>Activities</p></td><td rowspan="2">Meetings</td><td>Does not Equal "Held"</td></tr><tr><td>Does not Equal "Not Held"</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Tasks</td><td>Does not Equal "Completed"</td></tr><tr><td>Does not Equal "Deferred"</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Calls</td><td>Does not Equal "Held"</td></tr><tr><td>Does not Equal "Not Held"</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="8">History</td><td rowspan="2">Meetings</td><td>Equals "Held"</td></tr><tr><td>Equals "Not Held"</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Tasks</td><td>Equals "Completed"</td></tr><tr><td>Equals "Deferred"</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Calls</td><td>Equals "Held"</td></tr><tr><td>Equals "Not Held"</td></tr><tr><td>Emails</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Notes</td><td>N/A</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Since the Activities and History subpanels contain records from many different modules, there are some differences in the actions and record display than in normal subpanels.

Therefore, the My Activity Stream dashlet will restrict activity stream items to only those activities related to the Accounts module. Similarly, if the dashlet is added to the Opportunity module's Intelligence Pane, the My Activity Stream dashlet will restrict activity stream items to only those activities related to the Opportunities module. If the My Activity Stream dashlet is added to any record view's Intelligence Pane dashboard, the dashlet will restrict activity stream items to only those activities related to the record displayed in the main container on the page.</p><p>To filter the My Activity Stream dashlet, <a href="#Configuration_Options" class="selected">edit</a> the dashlet and click once on the Filter button.

Users can perform a search via the module's list view, record view, as well as global search. The module search allows you to locate records easily and effectively in a module-specific manner. Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the module list view or subpanel view of the record. Global search allows users to search for information across their entire Vodafone CRM database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. This documentation will go over the basics of the various search options and cover how to perform a search, filter a search, view results, etc.</p><h2 id="Global_Search"><a name="Global_Search_..136" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Global Search</h2><p>Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Vodafone CRM database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. For more information regarding searching within a single module, please refer to the <a href="#Sidecar_Modules)" class="selected">List View Search</a> and <a href="#Sidecar_Modules)" class="selected">Record View Search</a> section in this documentation. The Global Search bar is typically located on the top right hand side of each Vodafone CRM screen. Full Text Search is used with Global Search to search throughout nearly all fields and modules for an enhanced search experience. To use global search, you need to first enter the keyword into the search box and the pop-up results will begin appearing once you enter in at least one character. Clicking the magnifying glass icon or hitting your Return/Enter key will cause Vodafone CRM to return exact matches for your keyword rather than matches with words beginning with your keyword.</p><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8baa2712-d50f-cfd6-ee59-55030410accc.png" alt="" height="43" width="323" /></p><p>Please note that not all fields in Vodafone CRM are enabled by default for search.</p><p>Also, Global Search may or may not be case-sensitive depending on your database configuration. In general, Global Search on Vodafone CRM installations running on MySQL and MSSQL databases are not case-sensitive. But global search on a Vodafone CRM installation running on Oracle is case-sensitive by default. If your system is hosted on Vodafone CRM's On-Demand platform then your system is not case-sensitive by default. This allows searches performed for "rob" using a lowercase "r" to locate contact records in the system with a name of "Rob" with an uppercase "R".</p><p>Use the following steps to search for a contact name using Global Search:</p><ol><li value="1">Click into the Global Search box on the upper right of Vodafone CRM and type in your search (e.g. jane).</li><li value="2">Vodafone CRM will begin searching the system once you enter in at least four characters into the search box.</li><p>Please note that up to five results will be displayed along with the field that met your search criteria for each result.</p><li value="3">Click the record's name in the results dropdown list to access the record's details.</li><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/d333473b-e8ae-cc87-d52c-550304cb6d3a.png" alt="" height="137" width="228" /></p></ol><h3 id="Search_Operators"><a name="Search_Operators" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Search Operators</h3><p>Special search operator characters may be used to broaden or refine search results in Vodafone CRM. Use wildcard characters for a more flexible search or to fine tune results with the restrictive operators. Search operators can be combined for queries, but if quotation marks and wildcard characters are used together, the quotation marks will supersede the wildcard, resulting in a search for an exact match.</p><p>The following operators can be used in Global Search:</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Operator</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td>% or *</td><td>Use either of these wildcards to represent any number of characters, including zero.</td></tr><tr><td>?</td><td>Use this wildcard to represent a single character.</td></tr><tr><td>""</td><td>Restrict search results to exact matches of the entire word or group of words within the double quotes. Using quotes in combination with a wildcard will negate the wildcard resulting in an exact match search.</td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Do not include search results that contain the phrase that follows the minus sign.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Please note that a wildcard is implied at the end of all search queries. For example, searching for "Acme" will match account names like Acme Industries or Acme Funds. Insert a wildcard before your search query with a % sign (%Acme) to match account names that begin with or contain the query, such as "ABC Acme Industries". If performing a multiple word search, the wildcard is only appended to the last word, not all words. If you click the search button or hit Enter/Return, the wildcard will no longer be appended and Vodafone CRM will only search for an exact match of your search criteria.</p><p>The following are examples of Global Search queries using search operators:</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Search Query</strong></td><td><strong>Matches</strong></td><td><strong>Does Not Match</strong></td></tr><tr><td>robe</td><td><strong>Robe</strong>rt, <strong>Robe</strong>rto</td><td>Bob, Jacob</td></tr><tr><td>%bert</td><td>Al<strong>bert</strong>, <strong>Bert</strong>, Ro<strong>bert</strong></td><td>Bart</td></tr><tr><td>r?b?</td><td><strong>Robe</strong>rt, <strong>Rube</strong>nstein</td><td>Bob, Raab</td></tr><tr><td>%s?i</td><td>Du<strong>sti</strong>n, Chri<strong>sti</strong>, <strong>Smi</strong>th</td><td>Sophie, Josephine</td></tr><tr><td>??it</td><td><strong>Frit</strong>z, <strong>Smit</strong>h</td><td>Rita, Schmitt</td></tr><tr><td>r?b% AND smit%</td><td><strong>R</strong>o<strong>b</strong>ert <strong>Smit</strong>h, <strong>R</strong>o<strong>b</strong><strong>Smit</strong>e</td><td>Bob Smith, Robert Phillip</td></tr><tr><td>rob smit</td><td><strong>Rob Smit</strong>h, <strong>Rob Smit</strong>e</td><td>Robert Smith, Robert Smite</td></tr><tr><td>"smith"</td><td><strong>Smith </strong>&amp; Sons,<strong> Smith </strong>Corp</td><td>Smithson Corp</td></tr><tr><td>"Rob Smith"</td><td><strong>Rob Smith</strong>, The<strong> Rob Smith </strong>Corp</td><td>Rob Smitherson, Aaron Smith</td></tr><tr><td>Smith -Rob</td><td>Jane<strong> Smith</strong></td><td>Rob Smith, Robert Smith</td></tr></tbody></table><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a4e4f7d3-6b10-f38b-2464-5503043c45f6.png" alt="" height="293" width="246" /></p><h3 id="AND_vs_OR"><a name="AND_vs_OR" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>AND vs OR</h3><p>Global Search uses the "or" operator by default when multiple keywords are entered in the search box. For example, if you enter in "jane smith" into the search box, Vodafone CRM will look for records that match "jane" or "smith". In the example below, "Tod Wren" appears on the results list as the related Account name has "Smith" in it, and John Smith appears because his last name matches "smith". </p><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/5a3731a1-0220-0fcc-7ac9-550304e153fc.png" alt="" height="216" width="232" /></p><p>Another advantage Full Text Search has is the ability to overwrite the default "or" operator with an "and" operator. To use an "and" operator, simply add an all caps "AND" between the two words you are searching. Using the example above, you can perform an exact search to only return results for records that match both "jane" and "smith". Please note that the "AND" must be capitalized or Vodafone CRM will consider it a keyword to search on and the "OR" operator will be applied still.</p> <p><strong><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/1ffdc821-1bff-8763-c0a3-5503049fc573.png" alt="" height="133" width="231" /></strong></p><h3 id="View_All_Results"><a name="View_All_Results" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>View All Results</h3><p>Click the View all results link at the bottom of the results window to see all results from your search.

The matching records will populate in the list view below the Search bar. Please note that the system retrieves all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. Vodafone CRM also automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %services). This will return any record that has the word "services" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends. For more information on how to use wildcards in module searches, please refer to the <a href="#Wildcards_2" class="selected">Wildcards</a> section of this documentation. To clear the search, simply click the "x" to the right of the search keyword and all records to which you have access will display on the list view.</p><p>In addition, the search provides a Filter option allowing you to narrow your search further using the available options on the list.

For example, if you select "My Accounts" in the Filter list and enter an account name, Vodafone CRM will only return account records with a matching name that are assigned to you. You can also create new filters if you wish to add more complex filters for your search criteria. For more information on creating new filters, please refer to the <a href="#Creating_a_Filter" class="selected">Creating a Filter</a> section of this documentation.</p><p>To see all records to which you have access, simply select the All "Module Name" (e.g. All Accounts) option in the filter.

Use a wildcard character in place of characters you do not require in your search. You may use any combination of wildcard characters in the Search box as you desire. Search operators can be combined for queries, but if quotation marks and wildcard characters are used together, the quotation marks will supersede the wildcard, resulting in a search for an exact match. The following wildcard characters can be used in the List View module search:</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Character</strong></td><td><strong>Wildcard Use</strong></td></tr><tr><td>%</td><td>Use this wildcard to represent any number of characters, including zero</td></tr><tr><td>_</td><td>Use this wildcard to represent a single character</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Please note that a wildcard is implied at the end of all search queries. For example, searching for "Acme" will match account names like Acme Industries or Acme Funds. Insert a wildcard before your search query with a % sign (%Acme) to match account names that begin with or contain the query, such as "ABC Acme Industries". If performing a multiple word search, the wildcard is only appended to the last word, not all words.</p><p>The following are example searches using wildcards in List View search:</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Search Criteria</strong></td><td><strong>Matches</strong></td><td><strong>Does Not Match</strong></td></tr><tr><td>rob</td><td><strong>Rob</strong>, <strong>Rob</strong>ert, <strong>Rob</strong>in</td><td>Bob, Jacob</td></tr><tr><td>%bert</td><td>Al<strong>bert</strong>, <strong>Bert</strong>, Ro<strong>bert</strong></td><td>Bart</td></tr><tr><td>r_b</td><td><strong>Rob</strong>ert, <strong>Rub</strong>y</td><td>Bob, Raab</td></tr><tr><td>%s_i</td><td>Du<strong>sti</strong>n, Chri<strong>sti</strong>, <strong>Smi</strong>th</td><td>Sophie, Josephine</td></tr><tr><td>__it</td><td><strong>Nit</strong>a, <strong>Lit</strong>trell</td><td>Schmitt</td></tr><tr><td>r_b% smit%</td><td><strong>Rob</strong>ert <strong>Smit</strong>h, <strong>Rob</strong><strong>Smit</strong>e</td><td>Bob Smith, Robert Phillip</td></tr><tr><td>rob smit</td><td><strong>Rob Smit</strong>h, <strong>Rob Smit</strong>e</td><td>John Smith</td></tr></tbody></table><p>When performing a search, Vodafone CRM will try to match your search text to the beginning of a record's field. Therefore, if an account name starts with an article like "A" or "The", this must be accounted for in the search by adding a wildcard (%) at the beginning of your text. For example, to properly return an account named "The ABC Company", you could enter "%abc" for Vodafone CRM to find a match in the system.</p><p>In addition, you can use the wildcard character when specifying the search criteria for custom filters with the "starts with" operator. Please note that the wildcard character will only work with the "starts with" operator. For example, if you wish to find all records containing the word "systems", then you can use the "starts with" operator and type "%systems" as the filter value. For more information on creating filters, please refer to the <a href="#Creating_a_Filter" class="selected">Creating a Filter</a> section of this documentation. </p><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/a6c2cf2c-d9f1-2d03-5c6d-5503043073a6.png" alt="" height="76" width="562" /></p><h3 id="AND_vs_OR"><a name="AND_vs_OR_..137" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>AND vs OR</h3><p>When searching in the List View search, Vodafone CRM uses the "and" operator. This means that if you are searching against multiple fields in your filter option, Vodafone CRM will place an "and" in between each search field returning only records matching all (as opposed to any) of your search criteria. For example, if you select "My Accounts" in the Filter options and enter an account name, Vodafone CRM will only return account records with a matching name that are assigned to you.</p><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/541309a9-7b70-0a5d-2bbd-550304e808b5.png" alt="" width="631" height="109" /></p><p>The only time Vodafone CRM will use the "or" operator is when using a multi-select option in the search criteria. For example, you can create a custom filter for the Accounts list view search and select "Type", "is any of", then add "Customer", "Partner", and "Analyst". If you perform a search based on this new filter, the system will return account records that match any one of the values specified in the filter.

A common example of this would be a manager saving a search where only his or her employees are the Assigned Users on the record. This way, the manager can review all of their team's records at the click of a button.

This means that if you are searching against multiple fields, Vodafone CRM will place an "and" in between each search field returning only records matching all of your search criteria. For example: A search performed for a record name "Vodafone CRM" and the "My Items" check box will only return records where the record name contains "Vodafone CRM" and the assigned to field is the user currently logged in.</p><p>The only time Vodafone CRM will use the "or" operator is when using the mutiselect options in the search criteria. For example : A search performed in the Accounts module for the industry field will allow you to select multiple options to search by. Performing a search on the industry field with Apparel, Banking, and Chemicals selected will return any records where industry is "Apparel" or "Banking" or "Chemicals".</p><p>If any other field is added into the search criteria the operators between the industry field and any other field will remain an "and" operator.</p><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/50c50910-f058-7fb1-09a8-55028d4a28d8.png" alt="" width="569" height="49" /></p><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/1d1fbb51-e20c-01e7-3cce-55028d9651cc.png" alt="" width="655" height="254" /></p><h3 id="Wildcards"><a name="Wildcards_..147" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Wildcards</h3><p>Wildcards can be used to search for criteria without including the entire word in the search. Use a wildcard character in place of characters you do not require in your search. Use may use any number of wildcard characters in any combination you desire. Search operators can be combined for queries, but if quotation marks and wildcard characters are used together, the quotation marks will supersede the wildcard, resulting in a search for an exact match. The following wildcard characters can be used in the related module filters in Vodafone CRM:</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Character</strong></td><td><strong>Wildcard Use</strong></td></tr><tr><td>%</td><td>Use this wildcard to match any number of characters, including zero</td></tr><tr><td>_</td><td>Use this wildcard to match a single character</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Please note that a wildcard is implied at the end of all search queries. For example, searching for "Acme" will match account names like Acme Industries or Acme Funds. Insert a wildcard before your search query with a % sign (%Acme) to match account names that begin with or contain the query, such as "ABC Acme Industries". If performing a multiple word search, the wildcard is only appended to the last word and not all words.</p><p>The following are example searches using wildcards in related record search:</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Search Criteria</strong></td><td><strong>Matches</strong></td><td><strong>Does Not Match</strong></td></tr><tr><td>rob</td><td><strong>Rob</strong>, <strong>Rob</strong>ert, <strong>Rob</strong>in</td><td>Bob, Jacob</td></tr><tr><td>%bert</td><td>Al<strong>bert</strong>, <strong>Bert</strong>, Ro<strong>bert</strong></td><td>Bart</td></tr><tr><td>r_b</td><td><strong>Rob</strong>ert, <strong>Rub</strong>y</td><td>Bob, Raab</td></tr><tr><td>%s_i</td><td>Du<strong>sti</strong>n, Chri<strong>sti</strong>, <strong>Smi</strong>th</td><td>Sophie, Josephine</td></tr><tr><td>__it</td><td><strong>Nit</strong>a, <strong>Lit</strong>trell</td><td>Schmitt</td></tr><tr><td>r_b% smit%</td><td><strong>Rob</strong>ert <strong>Smit</strong>h, <strong>Rob</strong><strong>Smit</strong>e</td><td>Bob Smith, Robert Phillip</td></tr><tr><td>rob smit</td><td><strong>Rob Smit</strong>h, <strong>Rob Smit</strong>e</td><td>John Smith</td></tr></tbody></table><p>When performing a search, Vodafone CRM will try to match your search text to the beginning of a record's field. Therefore, if an account name starts with an article like "A" or "The", this must be accounted for in the search by adding a wildcard (%) at the beginning of your text. For example, to properly return an account named "The ABC Company", you should enter "%abc" for Vodafone CRM to find a match in the system.</p><h3 id="Search_Memory"><a name="Search_Memory" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Search Memory</h3><p>Vodafone CRM by default automatically saves your most recent search criteria when leaving the module then repopulates the search fields the next time you return. For example: Perform a search in the Accounts module for "Vodafone CRM". Navigate away from the Accounts module and then return back to the Accounts module. The search for "Vodafone CRM" will automatically be shown and the relevant results will be shown below in the list view.</p><p><strong>Note</strong> : This can be an unintended result if a user is unaware of this functionality. For example: A search may have an assigned user selected that is not currently visible in the scrolling selection box. When running a new search, best practice is to click the Clear button before entering your search criteria.</p><p>Module search memory can be set to one of the following options:</p><ul><li value="1"><strong>Remember last search</strong> : This is the default behavior in Vodafone CRM</li><li value="2"><strong>Populate only</strong> : This will populate the search criteria, but will not execute the search. </li><p><strong>Note</strong> : This is recommended for systems experiencing performance issues.</p><li value="3"><strong>Do not remember last search</strong> : Search will be cleared and executed every time the search is loaded</li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: These options are global settings and will affect all users.

Please note that Vodafone CRM automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %smith). This will pull up any record that has the word "smith" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p><p>For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="#Search" class="selected">Search</a> documentation.</p><h3 id="Module_Search"><a name="Module_Search_..170" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Module Search</h3><p>Module search enables users to easily search by lead name within the Leads module and pull up matching records in the list view. Records are deemed as matching when their first or last names start with any of the terms entered in the open Search box.

Contact records are typically related to an account record, and multiple contacts may be associated to a single account. There are various ways you can create contacts in Vodafone CRM such as via the Contacts module, importing contacts, converting leads to contacts, etc. Once the contact record is created, you can view and edit information pertaining to the contact via the Contacts record view. Each contact record may then relate to other Vodafone CRM records such as meetings, cases, opportunities, and many others, making the contact record a hub for viewing and continuing your interaction with the individual. This documentation will cover how to use the Contacts module as well as the various actions and options available from within the module.</p><h2 id="Contact_Fields"><a name="Contact_Fields" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Contact Fields</h2><p>The Contacts module contains a number of stock fields which come out-of-the-box with Vodafone CRM.

In Vodafone CRM Enterprise and Ultimate, the opportunity record acts as a header for one or more revenue line item records. This allows for greater granularity when working opportunities and forecasting since each line item within an opportunity can have it's own sales stage and probability as well as being included or excluded from a user's forecasting worksheet individually.</p><p>Each revenue line item may be related to a product from your organization's Product Catalog. Doing so will cause the product's values to automatically populate matching fields on the revenue line item. For more information about the Product Catalog, please refer to the <a href="Sugar_Enterprise_Administration_Guide.html#Product_Catalog">Products and Quotes</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p><p>There are various ways you can create revenue line items in Vodafone CRM such as via the Opportunities module, Revenue Line Items module, duplication, import, etc. This documentation will cover how to use the Revenue Line Items module as well as the various actions and options available from within the module.</p><h2 id="Revenue_Line_Item_Fields"><a name="Revenue_Line_Item_Fields" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Revenue Line Item Fields</h2><p>The Revenue Line Items module contains a number of stock fields which come out-of-the-box with Vodafone CRM.

Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Revenue Line Items list view below. Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Vodafone CRM database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Please note that Vodafone CRM automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %services). This will pull up any record that has the word "services" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p><p>For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="#Search" class="selected">Search</a> documentation.</p><h3 id="Module_Search"><a name="Module_Search_..338" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Module Search</h3><p>Module search enables users to easily search by revenue line item name within the module and pull up matching records in the list view. The search also provides a Filter option which can be used in combination with the open Search box to narrow your search further using the available options as follows:</p><ul><li value="1"><strong>Create</strong> : Create a new custom filter which you can use to filter your search</li><p><strong>Note</strong>: You can also click "Create" to the right of the Filter option.</p><li value="2"><strong>All Revenue Line Items</strong> : Returns all records in the module to which you have access</li><li value="3"><strong>My Favorites</strong> : Returns only records you have marked as favorites</li><li value="4"><strong>My Revenue Line Items</strong> : Returns only records assigned to you</li><li value="5"><strong>Recently Created </strong>: Returns only records you created in the module within the last 7 days</li><li value="6"><strong>Recently Viewed </strong>: Returns only records you have viewed in the module within the last 7 days</li></ul><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/bde97823-2488-48d4-dc5b-550306676abf.png" alt="" width="486" height="243" /></p><p>When you choose a filter, Vodafone CRM will return revenue line items which match both the selected filter and any name provided in the "Search by revenue line item..." bar in the filtered list view results. For example, if you select "My Revenue Line Items" in the Filter options and enter a revenue line item name, Vodafone CRM will only return revenue line item records with a matching name that are assigned to you. Once the search is complete, the relevant results will populate in the <a href="#Revenue_Line_Items_List_View" class="selected">list view</a> below the search bar. To see all revenue line item records to which you have access, simply select the All Revenue Line Items option in the filter and clear any text from the search bar. You can also click the Clear icon within the selected filter option (e.g. My Revenue Line Items) in the Search bar to clear the filter and pull up all list view search results.

You have the option to add multiple fields to your new filter by clicking the Plus button to the right of the filter selection dropdown lists and set select operators along with their value(s). A filter's criteria need to be true for a record in order for it to appear in the list view search result.

This conversion rate is used to calculate the converted amounts when the field is set to use the system default currency (as opposed to the user's preferred currency which is explained below). To keep amounts historically accurate, the conversion rate will only update on a revenue line item provided the sales stage is not set to "Closed Won" or "Closed Lost". If the line item is in any other sales stage, the conversion rate will update under the following scenarios:</p><ul><li value="1">The revenue line item undergoes a save event (e.g. mass update, manual save, etc.) and the record's currency has a different conversion rate defined in Admin &gt; Currencies than is currently saved in the opportunity.</li></ul><p>When the viewing user's profile has the Show Preferred Currency option selected, the converted amounts display in the user's preferred currency. In this case, the conversion rate used to calculate the converted amounts is drawn directly from the conversion rate at the system level rather than any conversion rate stored on the record. This means that the value will always use the current conversion rate regardless of the line item's sales stage. For this reason, the converted amount fields should not be considered historically accurate for closed revenue line items when it is using the user's preferred currency. For information about setting a user's Preferred Currency and Show Preferred Currency options, please refer to the <a href="#Locale_Settings" class="selected">User Profile</a> documentation.</p><p>For more information about currency exchange rates, please refer to the <a href="Sugar_Enterprise_Administration_Guide.html#Currencies">Currencies</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p><h1 id="Opportunities"><a name="Opportunities" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Opportunities</h1><h2 id="Overview"><a name="Overview_..380" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Overview</h2><p>Vodafone CRM's Opportunities module allows you to track individual sales and the line items belonging to those sales from start to finish.

This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %services). This will pull up any record that has the word "services" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p><p>For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="#Search" class="selected">Search</a> documentation.</p><h3 id="Module_Search"><a name="Module_Search_..391" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Module Search</h3><p>Module search enables users to easily search by opportunity name within the Opportunities module and pull up matching records in the list view.

This conversion rate is used to calculate the Converted Amount when the field is set to use the system default currency (as opposed to the user's preferred currency which is explained below). To keep amounts historically accurate, the conversion rate will only update on a quote provided the quote stage is not set to "Closed Accepted", "Closed Lost", or "Closed Dead". If the quote is in any other stage, the conversion rate will update under the following scenarios:</p><ul><li value="1">The quote undergoes a save event (e.g. mass update, manual save, etc.) and the record's currency has a different conversion rate defined in Admin &gt; Currencies than is currently saved in the quote.</li></ul><p>When the viewing user's profile has the Show Preferred Currency option selected, the Converted Amount field displays the Transactional Amount in the user's preferred currency. In this case, the conversion rate used to calculate the Converted Amount's value is drawn directly from the conversion rate at the system level rather than any conversion rate stored on the record. This means that the value will always use the current conversion rate regardless of the opportunity's sales stage. For this reason, the Converted Amount field should not be considered historically accurate for closed quotes when it is using the user's preferred currency. For information about setting a user's Preferred Currency and Show Preferred Currency options, please refer to the <a href="#Locale_Settings" class="selected">Getting Started</a> documentation.</p><p>For more information about currency exchange rates, please refer to the <a href="Sugar_Enterprise_Administration_Guide.html#05_System">System</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p><h1 id="Quoted_Line_Items"><a name="Quoted_Line_Items" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Quoted Line Items</h1><h2 id="Overview"><a name="Overview_..473" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Overview</h2><p>Vodafone CRM's Quoted Line Items module consists of all products that have already been sold or are in the process of being sold to clients.

This conversion rate is used to calculate the converted amountswhen they are set to use the system default currency (as opposed to the user's preferred currency which is explained below). To keep amounts historically accurate, the conversion rate will only update on a quoted line itemprovided the status is not set to "Shipped". If the line itemis in any other sales stage, the conversion rate will update under the followingscenarios:</p><ul><li value="1">The quoted line itemundergoes a save event (e.g. mass update, manual save, etc.) and the record's currency has a different conversion rate defined in Admin &gt; Currencies than is currently saved in the line item.</li><li value="2" /></ul><p>When the viewing user's profile has the Show Preferred Currency option selected, the converted amountfields display in the user's preferred currency. In this case, the conversion rate is drawn directly from the conversion rate at the system level rather than any conversion rate stored on the record. This means that the value will always use the current conversion rate regardless of the quoted line item'sstatus. For this reason, the Price and List fields should not be considered historically accurate for closed business when it is using the user's preferred currency.

The record view opens in edit mode when creating the meeting directly from the Meetings menu, Quick Create menu , and Calendar module and includes all of the relevant fields for your organization. When using quick create to make a meeting while viewing an existing record of another module, Vodafone CRM automatically creates a relationship between both records. For example, if you are viewing a contact or lead record (e.g. John Smith) and create a new meeting via their record view, the Related To field in the meeting record will automatically populate to "John Smith", thus creating the relationship and adding him as an invitee, as well as adding his associated account. Please note that if a meeting is created through the subpanel in a contact or lead record, they can not be removed as an invitee during the creation process.</p><h3 id="Creating_Via_Meetings_Module"><a name="Creating_Via_Meetings_Module" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Creating Via Meetings Module</h3><p>One of the most common methods of meeting creation is via the Meetings module using the Schedule Meeting option in the module tab.

Each Vodafone CRM instance has its own unique Vodafone CRM Email Archiving mailbox. To import emails, a user sends or forwards emails to the unique Vodafone CRM Email Archiving email address using the To, Cc, or Bcc fields. The Vodafone CRM Email Archiving service will import the email into the Vodafone CRM instance. The service imports the email, along with any attachments, images, and calendar events, then creates records within the application that are associated with existing records by matching email addresses in the To and Cc fields. In addition, the Vodafone CRM Email Archiving service will also scan the body of the email to archive the email to records with a matching email address. Please note that in order for the email address to be recognized properly for email archiving, it must be displayed as "To: (End Client Name (optional)) " (e.g. To: John Smith john@example.com&gt;) in the body of the email. The archived email will appear in the History dashlet for any matching records in Vodafone CRM. The imported emails will also be related to a specified case number by including the case macro and the case number (i.e. [CASE:{number}]) in the subject of the email.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Email Archiving cannot read email addresses from the Bcc field the same as when you receive an email.</p><p>Emails can be sent to the Vodafone CRM Email Archiving address and viewed in the History dashlets in Record View pages for the following modules:</p><ul><li value="1">Accounts</li><li value="2">Contacts</li><li value="3">Leads</li><li value="4">Opportunities</li><li value="5">Cases</li></ul><p>Emails with .ics meeting attachments sent to SNIP are parsed by Vodafone CRM. The Meeting record is created and for every email that is invited to the meeting, if User, Contact or Lead record exists matching this email, this record is added to the list of invitees for the meeting. </p><p>Email Archiving can be configured via Admin &gt; Email Archiving. For more information on how to setup and configure Email Archiving, please refer to the <a href="Sugar_Enterprise_Administration_Guide.html#Email_Archiving">Email</a> documentation in the administration guide.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: If the email client is configured to use non-English From, To, and Cc fields, forwarding emails inline to Email Archiving may not work. Send the email to Email Archiving directly using the Cc and Bcc fields or forward the email as an attachment. For large volume of non-English emails that need to be archived using Email Archiving, set a rule in your email application to copy the emails to the SNIP email address. </p><h1 id="Tasks"><a name="Tasks" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Tasks</h1><h2 id="Overview"><a name="Overview_..711" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Overview</h2><p>Vodafone CRM's Tasks module consists of flexible actions, to-do items, or other types of activity which requires completion.

Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Tasks list view below. Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Vodafone CRM database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Please note that Vodafone CRM automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %schedule). This will pull up any record that has the word "schedule" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p><p>For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="#29" class="selected">Search</a> documentation.</p><h3 id="Module_Search"><a name="Module_Search_..722" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Module Search</h3><p>Module search enables users to easily search by task name within the Tasks module and pull up matching records in the list view.

For example, if you select "My Tasks" in the Filter options and enter a task name, Vodafone CRM will only return task records with a matching name that are assigned to you. Once the search is complete, the relevant results will populate in the <a href="#Tasks_List_View" class="selected">list view</a> below the search bar. To see all task records to which you have access, simply select the All Tasks option in the filter and remove any text from the search bar. You can also click the Clear icon within the selected filter option (e.g. My Tasks) in the Search bar to clear the filter and pull up all list view search results.

You have the option to add multiple fields to your new filter by clicking the Plus button to the right of the filter selection dropdown lists and set select operators along with their value(s). A filter's criteria need to be true for a record in order for it to appear in the list view search result. Additionally, filters with no specified values may be saved as a custom filter to act as a filter template when a user often searches using the same fields but with varying values.

Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Notes list view below. Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Vodafone CRM database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Please note that Vodafone CRM automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %services). This will pull up any record that has the word "services" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends. </p><p>For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="#29" class="selected">Search</a> documentation.</p><h3 id="Module_Search"><a name="Module_Search_..775" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Module Search</h3><p>Module search enables users to easily search by note subject within the Notes module and pull up matching records in the list view.

Please note that Vodafone CRM automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %smith). This will pull up any record that has the word "smith" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p><p>For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="#Search" class="selected">Search</a> documentation.</p><h3 id="Module_Search"><a name="Module_Search_..819" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Module Search</h3><p>Module search enables users to easily search by target name within the Targets module and pull up matching records in the list view. Records are deemed as matching when their first or last names start with any of the terms entered in the open Search box. The search also provides a Filter option which can be used in combination with the open Search box to narrow your search further using the available options as follows:</p><ul><li value="1"><strong>Create</strong> : Create a new custom filter which you can use to filter your search</li><ul><li value="1"><strong>Note</strong>: You can also click "Create" to the right of the Filter option.</li></ul><li value="2"><strong>All Targets</strong> : Returns all records in the module to which you have access</li><li value="3"><strong>My Favorites</strong> : Returns only records you have marked as favorites</li><li value="4"><strong>My Targets </strong>: Returns only records assigned to you</li><li value="5"><strong>Recently Created </strong>: Returns only records you created in the module within the last 7 days</li><li value="6"><strong>Recently Viewed </strong>: Returns only records you have viewed in the module within the last 7 days</li></ul><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/87c907da-a4d8-8baa-72c3-55030978c1bf.png" alt="" height="262" width="537" /></p><p>When you choose a filter, Vodafone CRM will return targets which match both the selected filter and any name provided in the "Search by first name, last name..." bar in the filtered list view results. For example, if you select "My Targets" in the Filter options and enter a target name, Vodafone CRM will only return target records with a matching name that are assigned to you. Once the search is complete, the relevant results will populate in the <a href="#Targets_List_View" class="selected">list view</a> below the search bar. To see all target records to which you have access, simply select the All Targets option in the filter and remove any text from the search bar. You can also click the Clear icon within the selected filter option (e.g. My Targets) in the Search bar to clear the filter and pull up all list view search results.

For more information on configuring outbound email, please refer to <a href="#Set_Up_Email" class="selected">Set Up Email</a> below or to the <a href="Sugar_Enterprise_Administration_Guide.html#Outgoing_Mail_Configuration">Email</a> documentation in the Administration Guide.</li><li value="2"><strong>Campaign Batch Size</strong> : Specify the number of emails sent per batch via Admin &gt; Campaign Email Settings. Due to some email providers throttling the number of emails allowed to be sent at one time, we recommend setting this to 200 and adjusting as necessary. For more information on configuring the campaign batch size, please refer to <a href="#Set_Up_Email" class="selected">Set Up Email</a> below or to the <a href="Sugar_Enterprise_Administration_Guide.html#Campaign_Email_Settings">Email</a> documentation in the Administration Guide.</li><li value="3"><strong>Bounce Handling Account</strong> : Create the bounce-handling inbox for bounced campaign emails via Admin &gt; Inbound Email.

The frequency of this scheduler should be determined in conjunction with the campaign batch size to ensure you do not exceed sending limitations imposed by your email provider. For more information on configuring schedulers, please refer to the <a href="Sugar_Enterprise_Administration_Guide.html#Run_Nightly_Mass_Email_Campaigns">Schedulers</a> documentation in the Administration Guide.</li><li value="5"><strong>Bounced Emails Scheduler</strong> : Configure the scheduler job to process the bounced campaign emails via Admin &gt; Schedulers &gt; Run Nightly Process Bounced Campaign Emails Scheduler.

The main types and their differences are as follows:</p><ul><li value="1"><p><strong>Newsletter</strong> : A series of mass emails sent to a consistent or growing target list periodically or on a regular basis. Each newsletter is intended to be managed on a subscription basis and is normally targeted towards individuals with whom you have an existing relationship. The Frequency field is only available for campaigns with the type set to "Newsletter". Recipients opting out of newsletter-type campaigns are added to that campaign's unsubscription list but will still be able to receive other campaigns' emails.</p></li><li value="2"><p><strong>Email Campaign</strong> : A one-time or series of mass emails sent to a target list. Email campaigns are typically targeted towards a wide audience with the intention of lead generation. Recipients opting out of email-type campaigns have their email address marked as "opt-out" and are prevented from receiving any future campaign emails.</p></li><li value="3"><p><strong>Non-email based Campaign</strong> : A non-email mass marketing effort delivered via mail, web, radio, television, print, or telesales. These campaigns are not executed through Vodafone CRM, but you can create a campaign record and manually update send dates and results for record keeping and to assess return on investment.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: Non-email based campaigns will not display Tracker URLs and Email Marketing subpanels in the detail view.</p><h2 id="Creating_Campaigns"><a name="Creating_Campaigns" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Creating Campaigns</h2><p>There are two primary methods for creating a campaign in Vodafone CRM: the Create Campaign (Classic) option and the Create Campaign (Wizard) option.

The classic option is recommended for simplicity and empowering users to make modifications to the campaign later. The campaign wizard option will walk you through getting the campaign created step-by-step.

Target lists can contain any number and combination of contacts, leads, targets, users, and accounts. You have the option to associate existing target lists with your new campaign or to create new target lists during the campaign creation process.</p><p>The target list type determines some specific functionality within the campaign. The available target list types are "Default", "Seed", "Suppression List", and "Test". Default and Seed-type target lists will receive emails when campaigns are sent. Test-type target lists will receive emails when campaigns are tested.</p><p>Vodafone CRM will also create some target lists for you by default. For example, when selecting a campaign type of "Newsletter", Vodafone CRM automatically generates three target lists for the campaign: default-type "Subscription List", suppression by ID-type "Unsubscription List", and test-type "Test List". Please note that these three target list types are required for the Newsletter campaign. You may add additional target list types to the campaign as necessary. If you wish to remove the system generated target list types (e.g. suppression by ID-type "Unsubscription List"), please keep in mind that you must replace it with the same target list type (e.g. Suppression List - By Id).</p><p>For more information about target lists, please refer to the <a href="#Creating_Target_Lists" class="selected">Target Lists</a> documentation.</p><p>Use the following steps to add an existing target list to your campaign via the Target List subpanel on the Campaigns detail view:</p><ol><li value="1">Navigate to the Target List subpanel.</li><li value="2">Choose "Select" from the Actions menu.</li><p><strong>Note</strong>: Click the Create button if you wish to create a new target list for the campaign.</p><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/4872393c-e637-0951-7c2c-550307033326.png" alt="" width="275" height="120" /></p><li value="3">Locate and select the name of the desired target list in the pop-up window.

These links can be embedded into your email template to help you understand how your recipients are using the campaign email. When the link is clicked, it either opens a website, <a href="#Web-To-Lead_Forms" class="selected">web-to-lead form</a>, or other URL in your recipient's browser. If you choose to create your links as tracker links, then Vodafone CRM will log your recipient's clicks by assigning each tracker link a unique key and routing the link through Vodafone CRM before loading the final URL in their browser. The click-through results can be reported on and are visible in the Campaign Status section of the Campaigns module. For more information on the Campaign Status page, please refer to the <a href="#Campaign_Status" class="selected">Campaign Status</a> section of this documentation. A specific type of tracker URL is the opt-out link which allows the recipient to opt out of receiving your campaign emails instead of directing them to another web location.</p><h4 id="Creating_Redirect_URLs"><a name="Creating_Redirect_URLs" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Creating Redirect URLs</h4><p>Redirect tracker URLs can appear as text or images in your campaign email and when clicked, will navigate your recipient's browser to the URL of your choice: a page within your organization's website, a targeted advertisement, or even a web-to-lead form where they can provide details that will be saved as a Vodafone CRM lead record. For more information on web-to-lead forms, please refer to the <a href="#Web-To-Lead_Forms" class="selected">Web To Lead Forms</a> documentation. The power of redirect URLs is that on each click they pass through your Vodafone CRM instance before arriving at their final destination. This allows the clicks to be tracked by your campaign to provide visibility into how your recipients are responding to the campaign.</p><p>Use the following steps to create a redirect URL via your campaign's detail view:</p><ol><li value="1">Navigate to the Tracker URLs subpanel.</li><li value="2">Click the Create button to create a new tracker URL.</li><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/7066fa04-312e-adbe-189a-5503075eb9fb.png" alt="" width="360" height="112" /></p><li value="3">Enter appropriate values in the fields on the page.

If an opt-out link is not included in the email template, Vodafone CRM will add a default opt-out link to the bottom of your campaign email. When targets click on the Opt-out link, Vodafone CRM logs the action for your records and the target receives a message stating they have elected to opt out of receiving future emails.</p><p>For a newsletter-type campaign, they will also be added to the suppression-type list which prevents them from receiving emails for that particular campaign in the future. In the case of an email-type campaign, their email address is marked as "Opted Out" on the target's record (e.g. Contact) to prevent them from receiving emails for any campaign. You must manually add your opt-out link by inserting the tracker URL into the email template via the Email Marketing record.</p> <p><strong>Note</strong>: Opt-out links for newsletters behave differently than other campaign types. When a target clicks an opt-out for a newsletter type campaign they are removed only from the specific campaign that sent the email.

You can locate duplicate records for cleanup using <a href="#Module_Search" class="selected">module search</a> from the Notes list view. Searching for notes with similar names or other information can turn search into a powerful, duplicates-finding tool. Vodafone CRM also provides a wizard for finding potential duplicates that is available from the Notes record view and may be used as shown below. If duplicate note records are detected, you can perform a merge per the <a href="#Merging_Cases" class="selected">Merging Cases</a> section of this documentation.</p><p>Please note that your ability to use the Find Duplicates action may be restricted by any role which prevents note deletion.

Communication regarding cases can be performed via emails and via the Case Portal and Cases module.</p><p>When using email communication, please note that administrators in Vodafone CRM must first configure the outbound mail server for the system via Admin &gt; Email Settings in order for users to send outbound emails. For more information on setting up the system email settings, please refer to the <a href="Sugar_Enterprise_Administration_Guide.html#Email_Settings">Email</a> documentation in the Administration guide. Users will also need to have their email settings configured in their user preferences prior to sending outbound email from the Emails module or Cases module. For more information on setting up your user preferences' email settings, please refer to the <a href="#Email_Settings" class="selected">Getting Started</a> documentation.</p><h3 id="Communicating_Via_Emails"><a name="Communicating_Via_Emails" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Communicating Via Emails</h3><p>Vodafone CRM allows emails to be archived to cases and visible in the <a href="#History_Dashlet" class="selected">History Dashlet</a> regardless of them being sent and received in Vodafone CRM directly. When an email is received by Vodafone CRM, using either Inbound Email or Email Archiving, Vodafone CRM will utilize a Case Macro to relate the email. The Case Macro is placed in the subject line of the email and contains the case number that the email should be related to. Case Macros are configurable by an administrator via Admin &gt; Inbound Email, but will typically use the standard format of [CASE:##] to be placed in the subject line. For more information on configuring the case macro, please refer to the <a href="Sugar_Enterprise_Administration_Guide.html#Modifying_the_Case_Macro">Inbound Email</a> documentation. The formatting of the macro is imperative for Vodafone CRM to properly read the subject of the email for import. For example, a proper subject line with the macro will be: "[CASE:125] System not responding".</p><p>One way that the emails can be received in Vodafone CRM to use the case macro is through a monitored inbound mailbox. This is a mailbox on your company's mail server that Vodafone CRM is granted the ability to read. For example, this would function where an email is sent from to <span>support@mycompany.com</span> and includes a proper case macro. Vodafone CRM would then poll the mailbox, find the case macro, and associate the email to the specified case in the macro. This can also be used by support representatives who are directly emailing with a customer. The group mailbox can be CC'd and, using the case macro, have the email thread archived. For more information on configuring an inbound email box, please refer to the <a href="Sugar_Enterprise_Administration_Guide.html#Creating_Group_Mail_Accounts">Inbound Email</a> documentation.</p><p>The other option that users have to archive emails is using Vodafone CRM's Email Archiving functionality. Email Archiving must be configured and enabled by administrators in Vodafone CRM via Admin &gt; Email Settings. Once configured, an email address will be generated that is specific to your instance of Vodafone CRM. When this email address receives an email, it scans the email for any email addresses. The email is then imported into Vodafone CRM, where the email is associated to any contact, lead, etc. containing an email address on the email. When including the case macro on the email, Vodafone CRM will also import this email to the referenced case. For more information on setting up Email Archiving, please refer to the <a href="Sugar_Enterprise_Administration_Guide.html#Email_Archiving">Email Archiving</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p><h3 id="Communicating_Via_Portal"><a name="Communicating_Via_Portal" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Communicating Via Portal</h3><p>The Case Portal can be used to both view and submit cases from a customer to a support department, but can also be used as a method of communication regarding a case. Both customers and Vodafone CRM users have the option to add notes to cases. Users can do this via the <a href="#History_Dashlet" class="selected">History Dashlet</a> . Customers have this as an available option when viewing the details of a case. For more information on using the Case Portal, please refer to the <a href="Sugar_Enterprise_7.6_Portal_Deployment_User_Guide.html#Adding_Notes_and_Attachments_to_Cases">Portal Deployment User Guide</a> . When a customer adds a note to the portal, the note will be available for viewing inside Vodafone CRM. Alternately, when a user adds a note to a case from Vodafone CRM and the "Display in Portal?" checkbox is selected on the note, the note will be available to view in the portal. These notes are visible by anyone tied to the account that the case is associated to and with access to the support portal.

Once the search is performed, the relevant results will be displayed in the Bugs list view below. Global Search allows users to search for information across their entire Vodafone CRM database as opposed to restricting search within a specific module. Please note that Vodafone CRM automatically appends the wildcard character (%) to the end of your search phrase. This allows the system to retrieve all records that start with the keyword entered in the search. If you would like to broaden the search, you can use the wildcard at the beginning of your text as well (e.g. %smith). This will pull up any record that has the word "smith" in the name, regardless of how it starts or ends.</p><p>For more information on using the various search methods as well as how wildcards are used in the different methods, please refer to the <a href="#Search" class="selected">Search</a> documentation.</p><h3 id="Module_Search"><a name="Module_Search_..1028" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Module Search</h3><p>Module search enables users to easily search by bug number within the Bugs module and pull up matching records in the list view.

For example, if you select "My Bugs" in the Filter options and enter a bug name, Vodafone CRM will only return bug records with a matching name that are assigned to you. Once the search is complete, the relevant results will populate in the <a href="#Bugs_List_View" class="selected">list view</a> below the search bar.

Before creating a new bug record, a good practice is to first check that the bug does not already exist in Vodafone CRM. You can locate duplicate records for cleanup using <a href="#Module_Search" class="selected">module search</a> from the Bugs list view. Searching for bugs with similar names or other information can turn search into a powerful, duplicates-finding tool. Vodafone CRM also provides a wizard for finding potential duplicates that is available from the Bugs record view and may be used as shown below. If duplicate bug records are detected, you can perform a merge per the <a href="#Merging_Bugs" class="selected">Merging Bugs</a> section of this documentation.</p><p>Check with your system administrator if you do not see the Find Duplicates option.</p><p>Use the following steps to locate duplicate bugs using the Find Duplicates option from the Bugs record view:</p><ol><li value="1">Navigate to an bug's record view.</li><li value="2">Choose "Find Duplicates" from the Actions menu. </li><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/f315d8b1-5c15-79b7-d189-550308d238f1.png" alt="" width="450" height="190" /></p><li value="3">Potential duplicate bug records will be listed on the Find Duplicates page.

All filters, or groups of filters under an AND operator will need to be true for a record in order for that record to appear in the report result. Changing an operator to "OR" will mean that if any single filter under that "OR" is true for a record, the record will be included on the report. The OR operator accepts records matching any of the filters while the AND operator accepts records matching all filters.</p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/96de6094-0343-9f80-1210-55028a060742.png" width="338" height="84" alt="96de6094-0343-9f80-1210-55028a060742.png" /><h4 id="Filter_Groups"><a name="Filter_Groups" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Filter Groups</h4><p>By default, all filters will be added to a single group.

Vodafone CRM provides a set of pre-defined options to help you easily target the most common date ranges:</p><table cellpadding="4" border="1" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Date Range Filter</strong></td><td><strong>Definition</strong></td></tr><tr><td>On</td><td>A specific day</td></tr><tr><td>Before</td><td>Any value before the specified date</td></tr><tr><td>After</td><td>Any value after the specified date</td></tr><tr><td>Is Between</td><td>Any values after a specified start date but before a specified end date</td></tr><tr><td>Not On</td><td>Any values except the specified date</td></tr><tr><td>Is Empty</td><td>No date set for the field</td></tr><tr><td>Is Not Empty</td><td>Any date set for the field</td></tr><tr><td>Yesterday</td><td>A value set to the prior day</td></tr><tr><td>Today</td><td>A value set to the current day</td></tr><tr><td>Tomorrow</td><td>A value set to the following day</td></tr><tr><td>Last # Days</td><td>Any values within the last X days including the current day</td></tr><tr><td>Next # Days</td><td>Any values within the next X days including the current day</td></tr><tr><td>Last 7 Days</td><td>Any values within the last 7 days including the current day (e.g. Running on Monday includes the previous Tuesday morning through the end of the current Monday)</td></tr><tr><td>Next 7 Days</td><td>Any values within the next 7 days including current day (e.g. Running on Monday includes the the current Monday morning through the end the following Sunday)</td></tr><tr><td>Last Month</td><td>Any values that fall within the prior calendar month</td></tr><tr><td>This Month</td><td>Any values that fall within the current calendar month</td></tr><tr><td>Next Month</td><td>Any values that fall within the next calendar month</td></tr><tr><td>Last 30 Days</td><td>Any values within the last 30 calendar days including the current day</td></tr><tr><td>Next 30 Days</td><td>Any values within the next 30 calendar days including the current day</td></tr><tr><td>Last Quarter</td><td>Any values within the prior quarter defined by the calendar year (e.g. January - March, April - June, etc.)</td></tr><tr><td>This Quarter</td><td>Any values within the current quarter defined by the calendar year (e.g. January - March, April - June, etc.)</td></tr><tr><td>Next Quarter</td><td>Any values within the upcoming quarter defined by the calendar year (e.g. January - March, April - June, etc.)</td></tr><tr><td>Last Year</td><td>Any values within the prior calendar year</td></tr><tr><td>This Year</td><td>Any values within the current calendar year</td></tr><tr><td>Next Year</td><td>Any values within the upcoming calendar year</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Additionally, if your administrator has configured the Forecasts module via Admin &gt; Forecasts, additional options based on your organization's fiscal year will be available. If your fiscal year follows a traditional calendar year, these options will function in the same way as the corresponding options above:</p><table cellpadding="4" border="1" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Date Range Filter</strong></td><td><strong>Definition</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Previous Fiscal Year</td><td>Any values within the prior fiscal year</td></tr><tr><td>Previous Fiscal Quarter</td><td>Any values within the prior quarter defined by the fiscal year</td></tr><tr><td>Current Fiscal Year</td><td>Any values within the current fiscal year</td></tr><tr><td>Current Fiscal Quarter</td><td>Any values within the current quarter defined by the fiscal year</td></tr><tr><td>Next Fiscal Year</td><td>Any values within the upcoming fiscal year</td></tr><tr><td>Next Fiscal Quarter</td><td>Any values within the upcoming quarter defined by the fiscal year</td></tr></tbody></table><p>For more information about configuring the Forecasting module, please refer to the <a href="Sugar_Enterprise_Administration_Guide.html#10_Forecast">Forecast Configuration</a> documentation in the Administration guide.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>When generating reports with datetime filters, Vodafone CRM will always adjust the results to ensure they are accurate according to the time zone settings of the user accessing the report. For instance, a user on Eastern Standard Time (-5 GMT) may see a different set of results for a report than a user on Pacific Standard Time (-8 GMT) because the date ranges are adjusted for the user's time zone.</p><h3 id="Report_Display_Columns"><a name="Report_Display_Columns" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Report Display Columns</h3><p>The display columns step allows users to select which field(s) they would like included when generating the report. The system will pull data specific to these fields based on the report criteria for the associated module record. When you select a field from the Available Fields list, they will be added to the right of the list with the displayed path of the field (e.g. Contacts &gt; Assigned to User &gt; User Name). The displayed field paths show users where the field is originating from to retrieve the value for the report. For example, although "Email Address" appears as a field in several modules (e.g. Accounts, Contacts, Leads, etc.), email addresses are actually stored in their own table and are related to the modules where they appear as opposed to being direct fields of those modules. So, the corresponding displayed path will show the primary module record, then the related module followed by the field name (e.g. Contacts &gt; Email Address &gt; Email Address) since the email address field is a field of the related Email Address module.</p><p>To remove any unecessary fields from the display column list, simply click the "-" sign to the far right of the displayed field path row.</p><h4 id="Changing_Display_Column_Labels"><a name="Changing_Display_Column_Labels" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Changing Display Column Labels</h4><p>By default, the selected display column fields will display stock labels which can be changed if you desire.

Please note that if you want your report to include records whether or not they have data in the fields, you will need to mark the displayed module relationship(s) in the Optional Related Modules section. For example, if you add the email address field as a display column for the New Leads report, the Optional Related Modules section will display "Leads &gt; Email Address". Check the box for the Email Address relationship in order to include all applicable results even if the lead record does not contain an email address. By default, Vodafone CRM treats all related modules in a report as mandatory meaning that an email address will be required for a lead record to be included.</p><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/3c2facc7-4178-a863-e4f0-55028a38a42e.png" width="529" height="237" alt="3c2facc7-4178-a863-e4f0-55028a38a42e.png" /></p><p>Leaving this box unchecked will exclude all lead records from your report that do not have an email address associated with them.</p><p>This holds true for all related modules.

For example, if you need to add all leads in the state of California to your target list, you can create a report based on the Leads module filtered by the Primary Address State field (e.g. CA). Once the report is created and saved, you can navigate to the Target Lists module to add the report results to the specific target list.

Vodafone CRM will first run the parent query, then, for each row of the parent query, it will run the child query.</p><p>Use the following steps to interlock a pair of simple queries as an example:</p><ol><li value="1">Create a custom query record called "All Users Query" with the following SQL statement:</li><p>Select id, user_name from users</p><li value="2">Create a second custom query record called "Accounts By Users Query" with the following SQL statement:</li><p>Select name, assigned_user_id from accounts where assigned_user_id = '{sub}id{sub}'</p><li value="3">Create a data format record called "All Users Format" with the Query Name field set to "All Users Query".</li><li value="4">Create a data format record called "Accounts By Users Format" with the Query Name field set to "Accounts By Users Query" and the Parent Data Format field set to "All Users Format".</li><li value="5">Create an advanced report record.</li><li value="6">From the advanced report's detail view, use the Select button to choose "All Users Format".</li><li value="7">Click the Run Report button.</li></ol><p>The '{sub}id{sub}' is inserted to the child query to refer to the parent query's current result row. In this example, Vodafone CRM will generate a list of user names and id's. Below each user row, a list of accounts assigned to that particular user will appear. The child query is returning assigned_user_id to help make the functionality clear.</p></p><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/8b3b02b1-bda5-a6c4-412a-5503077ff5ab.png" alt="" width="451" height="150" /></p><p>Please note that a child data format cannot be run from it's own record nor added to an advanced report record.

Depending on your business needs, you may run imports anywhere from multiple times per week to only once or twice per year. Regardless of the import frequency, all users follow the same import guidelines:</p><ul><li value="1"><strong>File Delimitation : </strong>Vodafone CRM accepts files that are delimited by a given separator, such as commas or tabs. The most common type of import will be using a CSV (Comma Separate Value) file, but Vodafone CRM will accept other file types as long as it recognizes the delimiter.</li><li value="2"><strong>Imposed Limitations : </strong>Vodafone CRM, by default, does not impose any type of import imitations. </li><li value="3"><strong>Scrub Data Before Import : </strong>It is strongly recommended that all data is reviewed and scrubbed before importing. It is much easier to see if you are importing good data or that you have removed all duplicates before importing than finding them after they are already in Vodafone CRM and are already in use by other users. In addition, you want to ensure standardized fields such as dates, phone numbers, etc. adhere to a common format so that the import will run as smooth as possible.</li><li value="4"><strong>Parent Records First :</strong> When importing any records that use a relationship to another module, such as the Account - Contact relationship, it is best to try importing the parent, or higher level, records first. This is demonstrated with a one-to-many relationship between the two modules. In this case, it is best to import accounts first and then contacts, which rely on account records.</li></ul><h2 id="Importing_New_Records"><a name="Importing_New_Records" data-mc-generated-bookmark="TOC"></a>Importing New Records</h2><p>The first type of import that will be covered is importing new records. Whether you are just starting a migration from another CRM to Vodafone CRM or if you are adding a new list of records that you have received, such as a new list of leads or accounts, this process will help to get the data into Vodafone CRM without having to manually enter each record. After preparing your import file, follow these steps to import the list into Vodafone CRM:</p><ol><li value="1">Navigate to the module tab for the module that you are importing into and select the import option. This will open the Import Wizard and bring you to the"Upload Import File" screen. </li><p><img src="Resources/Images/screens/app-guide/importing-updates-to-existing-records.png" alt="" width="207" height="208" /></p><li value="2">If you would like to review the Import File Template, you can download it from this page.

The process runs very similar to the new record import process described above.</p><p>The most important aspect to importing updates to existing records is that Vodafone CRM will only update records where there is a matching ID in the import file. Every Vodafone CRM record, regardless of what module it is in, is defined with an alphanumeric ID field. This field is typically a 36-character alphanumeric value but may be less if imported from a previous CRM. This field is the only way that the Import Wizard will know which record to update.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>All other fields (name, email address, etc.) are not considered unique and can have duplicates, so only the ID field will work to differentiate records for an update from import.</p><p>The ID field is not usually shown within Vodafone CRM and must be found either by running a report or an export within the module.</p><p>During the import, if there are any other records without ID fields and they are on the import file, they will create new records, which will create duplicates in your database.</p><p>To import updates, follow the steps below.</p><ol><li value="1">You will have to get the ID numbers for all of the records that you are going to be updating to prepare your import file. The most common methods are either by exporting a list of records from the module list view, or by running a report and exporting the results. For more information on exporting, please review the <a href="#Export" class="selected">Export</a> documentation. </li><p><strong>Export from List View :</strong> This option will include the record ID field, but it is recommended that you open the file in a spreadsheet editor (Microsoft Excel) and delete any columns that you are not updating. Be sure to leave the ID field and any required fields, such as Name, as the import will not complete without these. </p><p><strong>Export from Report : </strong>If you choose to run a report, be sure to include the ID field in your display columns so that the records can be matched up. You will also want to include any required fields, such as Name, as the import will not complete without these. Please note that only Rows and Columns reports can be used for exports. </p><p>After you have your file ready for import, you can proceed with working through the Import Wizard.</p><li value="2">Navigate to the module tab for the module that you are updating and select the import option. This will open the Import Wizard and bring you to the<strong> "</strong>Upload Import File" screen. </li><p><img src="Resources/Images/screens/app-guide/importing-new-records.png" alt="" width="207" height="208" /></p><li value="3">If you would like to review the Import File Template, you can download it from this page.

A common example of this would be how importing contacts without an account name would leave the contacts orphaned and not linked to any parent account. To solve this problem, Vodafone CRM allows one-to-many and one-to-one relationships to be imported during the standard import process. The available fields will vary depending on the module being imported and will show on the <a href="#Import_File_Template" class="selected">Import Template</a> .</p><p>Please note that when an opportunity is imported into Vodafone CRM, a revenue line item must also be imported and related to the opportunity in order to populate the amounts (e.g. best, likely, etc.) on the opportunity record. Be sure to include the opportunity ID and amounts on the revenue line item import file.</p><p>When importing a relationship, Vodafone CRM will need the related record's unique ID, or, in some cases, will accept the record's Name field. Examples of the fields that relate one module to another are explained below.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="1"><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Module</strong></p></td><td><strong>Module Related To</strong></td><td><p><strong>Field(s) Used For Relationship</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Instructions For Import</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="4">Accounts</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="2">Accounts</td><td>Member Of</td><td><p>On the import file, add a column for "Member Of".

When checking for duplicates, Vodafone CRM will mark any record as a duplicate if it cross references against any of the duplicate fields. For example, when importing Contacts, if you select Last Name and Email Address as your duplicate check fields, any record that has a matching last name and/or a matching email address to an existing contact in Vodafone CRM will be marked as a duplicate.</p></p><p><img src="http://support.sugarcrm.com/files/dd8eb20c-b75c-ddf4-bb7a-550286814a44.png" alt="" height="145" width="506" /></p><p>The duplicate check fields used in each module differ depending on what fields are available to the module.
